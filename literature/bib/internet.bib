  abstract  = {{The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to distribute routing information between autonomous systems (ASes), is a critical component of the Internet's routing infrastructure. It is highly vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks, due to the lack of a secure means of verifying the authenticity and legitimacy of BGP control traffic. This paper describes a secure, scalable, deployable architecture (S-BGP) for an authorization and authentication system that addresses most of the security problems associated with BGP. The paper discusses the vulnerabilities and security requirements associated with BGP, describes the S-BGP countermeasures, and explains how they address these vulnerabilities and requirements. In addition, this paper provides a comparison of this architecture to other approaches that have been proposed, analyzes the performance implications of the proposed countermeasures, and addresses operational issues}},

It also shows you how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks - Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python), and focuses on practical issues such as: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients. This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it.},

    has been discouraged for security reasons and other policies, such as random

It is designed to encrypt or block victim's data, including documents, backups, and databases, unless a ransom is paid. In this study, the authors present the results of their research on Windows crypto-ransomware during the last 3 years by exploring and discussing the relevant ransomware behaviours. The results of this study can be used to identify or to detect the ransomware. Indeed, these behaviours were extracted from in-depth manual analysis of more than 20 ransomware families, including the known and the recent families. In addition, some extracted behaviours were automatically searched for more than 200 different ransomware collected during 2019.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of large-scale worms, viruses and bot-nets have made Internet malware a pressing concern. Such infections are at the root of modern scourges including DDoS extortion, on-line identity theft, SPAM, phishing, and piracy. However, the most widely used tools for gathering intelligence on new malware -- network honeypots -- have forced investigators to choose between monitoring activity at a large scale or capturing behavior with high fidelity. In this paper, we describe an approach to minimize this tension and improve honeypot scalability by up to six orders of magnitude while still closely emulating the execution behavior of individual Internet hosts. We have built a prototype honeyfarm system, called Potemkin, that exploits virtual machines, aggressive memory sharing, and late binding of resources to achieve this goal. While still an immature implementation, Potemkin has emulated over 64,000 Internet honeypots in live test runs, using only a handful of physical servers.},

  abstract = {Measurement and analysis of modern malware systems such as botnets relies crucially on execution of specimens in a setting that enables them to communicate with other systems across the Internet. Ethical, legal, and technical constraints however demand containment of resulting network activity in order to prevent the malware from harming others while still ensuring that it exhibits its inherent behavior. Current best practices in this space are sorely lacking: measurement researchers often treat containment superficially, sometimes ignoring it altogether. In this paper we present GQ, a malware execution "farm" that uses explicit containment primitives to enable analysts to develop containment policies naturally, iteratively, and safely. We discuss GQ's architecture and implementation, our methodology for developing containment policies, and our experiences gathered from six years of development and operation of the system.},
