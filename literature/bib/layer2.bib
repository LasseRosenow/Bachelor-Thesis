We also analyze the correlation of these network performance characteristics with distance and carrier-to-interference-noise ratio (CINR). It is shown that the latter can be used for developing reliable and accurate semi-empirical models of these network performance characteristics. These models can then be used to estimate throughput, latency, and jitter by means of CINR measurements.},

Multicast and Broadcast (M&B) in WiMAX are suitable for multimedia applications such as Pay-TV system because multimedia providers can efficiently distribute the same contents to the users within the same M&B group. Although IEEE 802.16e has defined Multicast/Broadcast Rekeying Algorithm (MBRA) to secure M&B, recent research indicates that MBRA is insecure. In this paper, we propose an efficient rekeying scheme which depends on Linear Ordering of Receivers (LORE) to protect M&B group communication. Our scheme requires O(1) messages for rekeying and addresses the security problem of MBRA. Therefore, our rekeying scheme is suitable for protecting large dynamic groups such as M&B groups.},

abstract={Despite the increasing number of WiFi-based Long Distance (WiLD) network deployments, there is a lack of understanding of how WiLD networks perform in practice. In this paper, we perform a systematic study to investigate the commonly cited sources of packet loss induced by the wireless channel and by the 802.11 MAC protocol. The channel induced losses that we study are external WiFi, non-WiFi and multipath interference. The protocol induced losses that we study are protocol timeouts and the breakdown of CSMA over WiLD links. Our results are based on measurements performed on two real-world WiLD deployments and a wireless channel emulator. The two deployments allow us to compare measurements across rural and urban settings. The channel emulator allows us to study each source of packet loss in isolation in a controlled environment. Based on our experiments we observe that the presence of external WiFi interference leads to significant amount of packet loss in WiLD links. In addition to identifying the sources of packet loss, we analyze the loss variability across time. We also explore the solution space and propose a range of MAC and network layer adaptation algorithms to mitigate the channel and protocol induced losses. The key lessons from this study were also used in the design of a TDMA based MAC protocol for high performance long distance multihop wireless networks [12].},

abstract = {Current LoRa networks including those following the LoRaWAN specification use the primitive ALOHA mechanism for media access control due to LoRa's lack of carrier sense capability. From our extensive measurements, the Channel Activity Detection (CAD) feature that is recently introduced to LoRa for energy-efficiently detecting preamble chirps, can also detect payload chirps reliably. This sheds light on an efficient carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol that we call LMAC for LoRa networks. This paper presents the designs of three advancing versions of LMAC that respectively implements CSMA, balances the communication loads among the channels defined by frequencies and spreading factors based on the end nodes' local information and then additionally the gateway's global information. Experiments on a 50-node lab testbed and a 16-node university deployment show that, compared with ALOHA, LMAC brings up to 2.2\texttimes{} goodput improvement and 2.4\texttimes{} reduction of radio energy per successfully delivered frame. Thus, should the LoRaWAN's ALOHA be replaced with LMAC, network performance boosts can be realized.},

abstract = {LoRa has emerged as a promising Low-Power Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) technology to connect a huge number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The dense deployment and an increasing number of IoT devices lead to intense collisions due to uncoordinated transmissions. However, the current MAC/PHY design of LoRaWAN fails to recover collisions, resulting in degraded performance as the system scales. This paper presents FTrack, a novel communication paradigm that enables demodulation of collided LoRa transmissions. FTrack resolves LoRa collisions at the physical layer and thereby supports parallel decoding for LoRa transmissions. We propose a novel technique to separate collided transmissions by jointly considering both the time domain and the frequency domain features. The proposed technique is motivated from two key observations: (1) the symbol edges of the same frame exhibit periodic patterns, while the symbol edges of different frames are usually misaligned in time; (2) the frequency of LoRa signal increases continuously in between the edges of symbol, yet exhibits sudden changes at the symbol edges. We detect the continuity of signal frequency to remove interference and further exploit the time-domain information of symbol edges to recover symbols of all collided frames. We implement FTrack on a low-cost software defined radio. Our testbed evaluations show that FTrack demodulates collided LoRa frames with low symbol error rates in diverse SNR conditions. It increases the throughput of LoRaWAN in real usage scenarios by up to 3 times.},

The key enabling technology behind PCube is a novel air-channel phase measurement technique which is able to extract phase differences of air-channels between LoRa nodes and multiple antennas of a gateway. PCube leverages the reception diversities of multiple receiving antennas of a gateway and scales the concurrent transmissions of a large number of LoRa nodes, even exceeding the number of receiving antennas at a gateway. As a phase-based parallel decoder, PCube provides a new dimension to resolve collisions and supports more concurrent transmissions by complementing time and frequency based parallel decoders. PCube is implemented and evaluated with synchronized software defined radios and off-the-shelf LoRa nodes in both indoors and outdoors. Results demonstrate that PCube can substantially outperform state-of-the-art works in terms of aggregated throughput by 4.9\texttimes{} and the number of concurrent nodes by up to 5\texttimes{}. More importantly, PCube scales well with the number of receiving antennas of a gateway, which is promising to break the barrier of concurrent transmissions.},

abstract = {LoRa has seen widespread adoption as a long range IoT technology. As the number of LoRa deployments grow, packet collisions undermine its overall network throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel interference cancellation technique -- Concurrent Interference Cancellation (CIC), that enables concurrent decoding of multiple collided LoRa packets. CIC fundamentally differs from existing approaches as it demodulates symbols by canceling out all other interfering symbols. It achieves this cancellation by carefully selecting a set of sub-symbols -- pieces of the original symbol such that no interfering symbol is common across all sub-symbols in this set. Thus, after demodulating each sub-symbol, an intersection across their spectra cancels out all the interfering symbols. Through LoRa deployments using COTS devices, we demonstrate that CIC can increase the network capacity of standard LoRa by up to 10x and up to 4x over the state-of-the-art research. While beneficial across all scenarios, CIC has even more significant benefits under low SNR conditions that are common to LoRa deployments, in which prior approaches appear to perform quite poorly.},
