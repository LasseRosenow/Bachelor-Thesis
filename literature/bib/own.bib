Our approach provides ICN-idiomatic communication between networks with vastly different RTTs. We applied this framework to LoRa, enabling end-to-end consumer-to-LoRa-producer interaction over an ICN-Internet and asynchronous data production in the LoRa edge.
Instead of using LoRaWAN, we implemented an IEEE 802.15.4e DSME MAC layer on top of the LoRa PHY and ICN protocol mechanisms in RIOT OS. Executed on off-the-shelf IoT hardware, we provide a comparative evaluation for basic NDN-style ICN [60], RICE [31]-like pulling, and reflexive forwarding [46]. This is the first practical evaluation of ICN over LoRa using a reliable MAC. Our results show that periodic polling in NDN works inefficiently when facing long and differing RTTs. RICE reduces polling overhead and exploits gateway knowledge, without violating ICN principles. Reflexive forwarding reflects sporadic data generation naturally. Combined with a local data push, it operates efficiently and enables lifetimes of >1 year for battery powered LoRa-ICN nodes.},

  Current designs of future In-Vehicle Networks (IVN) prepare for switched Ethernet backbones, which can host advanced LAN technologies such as IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). In this paper, we present an integrated Time-Sensitive Software-Defined Networking (TSSDN) architecture that simultaneously enables control of synchronous and asynchronous real-time and best-effort communication for all IVN traffic classes. Despite the central SDN controller, we can validate that control can operate without a delay penalty for TSN traffic, provided protocols are properly mapped. We demonstrate how TSSDN adaptably and reliably enhances network security for in-vehicle communication. A systematic investigation of the possible control flow integrations with switched Ether-networks reveals that these strategies allow for shaping the attack surface of a software-defined IVN. We discuss embeddings of control flow identifiers on different layers, covering the range from a fully exposed mapping to deep encapsulation. We experimentally evaluate these strategies in a production vehicle, which we map to a modern Ethernet topology. Our findings indicate that visibility of automotive control flows on lower network layers enables isolation and access control throughout the network infrastructure. Such a TSSDN backbone can establish and survey trust zones within the IVN and reduce the attack surface of connected cars in various attack scenarios.},

Thereby, the scale of the loosely-federated delegation in DNS became an unprecedented cryptographic key management challenge. Though fundamental for current and future operational success, our community lacks a clear notion of how to empirically evaluate the process of securely transitioning keys.

  In this paper, we propose two building blocks to formally characterize and assess key transitions. First, the anatomy of key transitions, i.e., measurable and well-defined properties of key changes; and second, a novel classification model based on this anatomy for describing key transition practices in abstract terms. This abstraction allows for classifying operational behavior. We apply our proposed transition anatomy and transition classes to describe the global DNSSEC deployment.
  Specifically, we use measurements from the first 15 years of the DNSSEC rollout to detect and understand which key transitions have been used to what degree and which rates of errors and warnings occurred. In contrast to prior work, we consider all possible transitions and not only 1:1 key rollovers. Our results show measurable gaps between prescribed key management processes and key transitions in the wild. We also find evidence that such noncompliant transitions are needed in operations.},

  abstract  = {The deployment of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) on embedded wireless devices was first considered a decade ago. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), early experiments confirmed benefits for constrained multi-hop networks from operating Named-Data Networking (NDN) as a network layer directly on top of data links. Since then, a large body of work has proposed and evaluated ICN in the IoT context. Essential findings show that hop-wise forwarding with caching and a leaner network stack improve adaptability to lossy regimes and network performance over IP-style communication with end-to-end transport services. While a native deployment of the information-centric content replication already promotes a reliable and energy-efficient IoT edge, additional protocol extensions further reduce memory demands, improve the utilization of wireless network links, and decrease the overall power consumption.
Part I of this manuscript aims to develop an information-centric protocol suite that integrates with off-the-shelf IoT hardware and software platforms. A new convergence layer follows the design considerations of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN), and adapts ICN packets to the small-sized Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) of low-power links by providing (i) a stateless and stateful header compression scheme, (ii) link fragmentation, and (iii) protocol framing similar to EtherTypes. In addition to this link convergence, which operates below the actual ICN layer, a lightweight Quality of Service (QoS) scheme on the network layer improves the utilization of limited network buffers. It enables a coordinated resource management to reduce network latency and to prevent queue starvation for prioritized traffic flows. Since an intermittent connectivity and device mobility are common in wireless regimes of low reliability, this protocol suite further adds a lightweight publish-subscribe system to bolster the information-centric IoT against network disruptions, and to improve routing agility on connectivity loss. Part II examines the Internet perspective of native ICN IoT networks and then describes the construction of a data-centric Web of Things (WoT). This deployment option is based on standard protocol elements of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and replicates the information-centric principles (i) stateful forwarding, (ii) hop-wise caching, and (iii) content object security. Real protocol implementations and testbed assessments on actual IoT hardware show that the data-centric WoT adheres to the performance expectations of pure ICN deployments, while retaining full compatibility with Internet services. Additionally, this deployment option leads insights and techniques that emerged from ICN research into a promising, realistic deployment trail for the growing IoT.},

Configuring the underlying clock tree, however, involves a large parameter space with complex dependencies and dynamic constraints. We argue for clock configuration as a generic operating system module that bridges the gap between highly configurable but complex embedded hardware and easy  application development.	In this paper, we propose a method and a runtime subsystem for dynamic clock reconfiguration on constrained IoT devices named ScaleClock. ScaleClock derives measures to dynamically optimize clock configurations by abstracting  the hardware-specific clock trees. The ScaleClock system service grants portable access to the optimization potential of dynamic clock scaling for applications.  We implement the approach on the popular IoT operating system RIOT for two target platforms of different manufacturers and evaluate its performance in static and dynamic scenarios on real devices. We demonstrate the potential of ScaleClock by designing a platform-independent DVFS mechanism that enables RIOT to autonomously adapt the hardware performance to requirements of the software currently executed. In a use case study, we manage to boost energy efficiency of constrained network communication by reducing the MCU consumption by 40\% at negligible performance impact.},

A thoughtful API design is challenging, and it is beneficial to re-use such an interface and to share the knowledge of programming embedded security widely.

In this paper, we integrate an emerging cryptographic interface into usable system-level calls for the IoT operating system RIOT, which runs on more than 200 platforms. This interface supports ID-based key handling to access key material in protected storage without exposing it to anyone. Our design foresees hardware acceleration on all available variants; our implementation integrates diverse cryptographic hardware and software backends via the uniform interface. Our performance measurements show that the overhead of the uniform API with integrated key management is negligible  compared to the individual crypto operation.

Its transmission, though, is on one side prone to interference during long on-air times, and on the other side subject to duty cycle restrictions.

LoRaWAN circumvents the above limitations by imposing a centralized network architecture, which heavily reduces downlink capacity and prevents peer-to-peer communication. This makes it unusable for many deployments. The Deterministic and Synchronous Multichannel Extension (DSME) of IEEE 802.15.4e benefits of time-slotted communication and peer-to-peer communication and has the potential to overcome LoRaWAN limitations. In this work, we implement DSME on top of LoRa in the open source IoT OS RIOT and open the field for first evaluation experiments on real hardware.

Our performance evaluation on off-the-shelf IoT hardware shows that C2C communication outperforms server-centric deployments. First, LwM2M deployments with edge C2C communication yield a ~90\% faster notification delivery and ~4× greater throughput compared to common server-centric scenarios, while keeping a small memory overhead of ~8\%. Second, in server-centric communication, the delivery rate degrades when resource update intervals drop below 100 ms.},

  abstract = {Large-scale Internet scans are a common method to identify
    victims of a specific attack. Stateless scanning like in ZMap has been
      established as an efficient approach to probing at Internet scale.
      Stateless scans, however, need a second phase to perform the attack,
    which remains invisible to network telescopes that only capture the first
      incoming packet and is not observed as a related event by honeypots.  In
      this work, we examine Internet-wide scan traffic through Spoki, a
      reactive network telescope operating in real-time that we design and
      implement. Spoki responds to asynchronous TCP SYN packets and engages in
      TCP handshakes initiated in the second phase of two-phase scans.  Because
      it is extremely lightweight it scales to large prefixes where it has the
      unique opportunity to record the first data sequence submitted within the
      TCP handshake ACK.  We analyze two-phase scanners during a three months
      period using globally deployed Spoki reactive telescopes as well as flow
      data sets from IXPs and ISPs.  We find that a predominant fraction of TCP
      SYNs on the Internet has irregular characteristics. Our findings also
      provide a clear signature of today's scans as: (i) highly targeted, (ii)
      scanning activities notably vary between regional vantage points, and
      (iii) a significant share originates from malicious sources.},

The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) augments the network edge with reading sensors  and controlling actuators that comprise machine-to-machine communication using small data objects. IoT content objects are often messages that fit into single IPv6 datagram. These IoT messages  frequently traverse protocol translators at gateways, which break end-to-end transport and security of Internet protocols.   To preserve content security from end to end via gateways and proxies, the IETF recently developed Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), which extends the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) with content object security features commonly known from Information Centric Networking (ICN).

This paper revisits the current IoT protocol architectures and presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protect request-response transactions. We discuss features and limitations of the different protocols and analyze emerging functional extensions.
We measure the protocol performances of CoAP over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol on a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios.
Our findings indicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wireless regimes due to omitting the  overhead of maintaining security sessions at endpoints,  (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to its intrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions, and (c) OSCORE/CoAP offers room for improvement and optimization in multiple directions.},

  abstract = {Summary Industrial control systems (ICS) are managed remotely with the help of dedicated protocols that were originally designed to work in walled gardens. Many of these protocols have been adapted to Internet transport and support wide-area communication. ICS now exchange insecure traffic on an inter-domain level, putting at risk not only common critical infrastructure but also the Internet ecosystem (e.g., by DRDoS attacks). In this paper, we measure and analyze inter-domain ICS traffic at two central Internet vantage points, an IXP and an ISP. These traffic observations are correlated with data from honeypots and Internet-wide scans to separate industrial from non-industrial ICS traffic. We uncover mainly unprotected inter-domain ICS traffic and provide an in-depth view on Internet-wide ICS communication. Our results can be used (i) to create precise filters for potentially harmful non-industrial ICS traffic and (ii) to detect ICS sending unprotected inter-domain ICS traffic, being vulnerable to eavesdropping and traffic manipulation attacks. Additionally, we survey recent security extensions of ICS protocols, of which we find very little deployment. We estimate an upper bound of the deployment status for ICS security protocols in the Internet core.},

This work focuses on the interaction between possibly mobile sensors and actuators in such IoT regimes which deploy the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture. Constrained nodes in interactive scenarios need to be highly responsive but can only manage limited control state. We argue that the request-driven NDN networking paradigm, which prevents pushing of unsolicited data, should  be preserved to confine the attack surface, whereas unsolicited  link-local signaling can accelerate responses without sacrificing security.	
	
  In this paper, we contribute HoP-and-Pull (HoPP), a robust publish-subscribe scheme for typical IoT scenarios that targets low-power and lossy wireless networks running hundreds of resource constrained devices at intermittent connectivity.  Our approach limits in-memory forwarding state to a minimum and naturally supports producer mobility, a temporary partitioning of networks, data aggregation on intermediary hops, and near real-time reactivity.  We thoroughly evaluate the protocol by experiments in a realistic, large testbed with varying numbers of constrained devices, each interconnected via IEEE 802.15.4 wireless LoWPANs. We compare HoPP with common ICN pub-sub and mobility schemes as well as with basic MIPv6 and anchor-based multicast mobility.   Implementations are built on CCN-lite with RIOT and support experiments using various single- and multi-hop scenarios.},

A new frame format is specified to adapt CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header formats are described. To support compatibility with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching scheme provided by IPv6 over LoWPAN (6LoWPAN) is extended to include new dispatch types for CCNx and NDN. Additionally, the fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to Information-Centric Network (ICN) chunks. In its second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links. Stateless compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields for common use cases. Stateful compression schemes elide states local to the LoWPAN and replace names in Data packets by short local identifiers.

Additionally, we evaluate congestion control mechanisms for selective fragment recovery by increasing the feature set of congestion control. Direct fragment forwarding and selective fragment recovery are challenged by the lack of forwarding information at subsequent fragments in 6LoWPAN and thus require additional data at the nodes. We compare the four approaches in extensive experiments evaluating reliability, end-to-end latency, and memory consumption. Our findings indicate that direct fragment forwarding should be deployed with care, since higher packet transmission rates on the link layer can significantly reduce its reliability, which in turn can even further reduce end-to-end latency because of highly increased link layer retransmissions. Selective fragment recovery can compensate this disadvantage but struggles with the same problem underneath, constraining its full potential. Congestion control for selective fragment recovery should be chosen so that small congestion windows that are growable together with fragment pacing are used. In case of less fragments per datagram, pacing is less of a concern, but the congestion window has an upper bound.},

The city of Hamburg sponsored project Smart Networks for Urban Citizen Participation (SANE) aims at enabling citizens to connect existing sensors to create a city-wide data space while keeping control of devices and gathered data. Interconnecting these sensors enables all citizens to generate higher value information and thus improve their urban environmental awareness.

The demo presents how citizens connect to the city-wide data space, how data can be collected, processed, and shared in a privately manner.},

This fosters application portability across MCUs. We develop an automated benchmark suite that quantifies the abstraction overhead and compare API performance to current solutions.

The transmission exhibits low throughput and underlies duty cycle restrictions. Long on-air times (up to seconds) and range are susceptible to interference.

  LoRaWAN is the system that defines the LoRa PHY, MAC, and a complete vertical stack. To deal with the above limitations, LoRaWAN imposes rigorous constraints, namely, a centralized network architecture that organizes media access, and heavily reduced downlink capacity. This makes it unusable for many deployments, control systems in particular.

We present a DSME-LoRa mapping scheme and contribute a simulation model for validating new LoRa use-cases.

Unfortunately, common periodic scanning campaigns such as Shadowserver do not capture transparent forwarders and thus underestimate the current threat potential of the ODNS. Second, we find an increased deployment of transparent forwarders in Asia and South America. In India alone, the ODNS consists of 80% transparent forwarders. Third, many transparent forwarders relay to a few selected public resolvers such as Google and Cloudflare, which confirms a consolidation trend of DNS stakeholders. Finally, we introduce DNSRoute++, a new traceceroute approach to understand the network infrastructure connecting transparent forwarders and resolvers.},

In this work, we present both a fully open-source, configurable software platform and experiments to analyze multi-hop BLE network behavior. Our experiments, conducted in a larger testbed, reveal unexpected performance drawbacks. Even in scenarios with underutilized links, BLE connections break randomly. This results into large transmission delays on the network layer and thus hinders real-world deployments in the constrained IoT. As key reason for this behavior we identify the BLE connection interval. A deterministic interval leads to unpredictable link quality and connection losses due to overlapping connection events. We propose randomizing the connection intervals as mitigation strategy and demonstrate that this prevents connection losses and sporadic link degradation, improving the overall network behavior.},

Second, we assess the effectiveness of observed DNS attacks by studying IXP traces jointly with diverse data from independent measurement infrastructures. We find that attackers efficiently detect new reflectors and purposefully rotate between them. At the same time, we reveal that attackers are a small step removed from bringing about significantly higher amplification factors (14×). Third, we identify and fingerprint a major attack entity by studying patterns in attack traces. We show that this entity dominates the DNS amplification ecosystem by carrying out 59\% of the attacks, and provide an in-depth analysis of its behavior over time. Finally, our results reveal that operators of various .gov names do not adhere to recommended DNSSEC key rollover policies, which exacerbates amplification potential, and which we can verifiably connect to misuses and attacker decision-making.},

In this paper, we explore how information-centric networking can ease reliable firmware updates. We start from the recent standards developed by the IETF SUIT working group and contribute a system that allows for a timely discovery of new firmware versions by using cryptographically protected manifest files. Our design enables a cascading firmware roll-out from a gateway towards leaf nodes in a low-power multi-hop network. While a chunking mechanism prepares firmware images for typically low-sized maximum transmission units (MTUs), an early Denial-of-Service (DoS) detection prevents the distribution of tampered or malformed chunks. In experimental evaluations on a real-world IoT testbed, we demonstrate feasible strategies with adaptive bandwidth consumption and a high resilience to connectivity loss when replicating firmware images into the IoT edge.},

  abstract = "Developing an Operating System for low-end embedded devices requires continuous adaptation to new hardware architectures and components, while serviceability of features needs to be assured for each individual platform under tight resource constraints. It is challenging to design a versatile and accurate heterogeneous test environment that is agile enough to cover a continuous evolution of the code base and platforms. This mission is even more challenging when organized in an agile open-source community process with many contributors such as for the RIOT OS. Hardware in the Loop (HiL) testing and Continuous Integration (CI)  are automatable approaches to verify functionality, prevent regressions, and improve the overall quality at development speed in large community projects.

In this paper, we present PHiLIP (Primitive Hardware in the Loop Integration Product), an open-source external reference device together with tools that validate the system software while it controls hardware and interprets physical signals. Instead of focusing on a specific test setting, PHiLIP takes the approach of a tool-assisted agile HiL test process, designed for continuous evolution and deployment cycles. We explain its design, describe how it supports HiL tests, evaluate performance metrics, and report on practical experiences of employing PHiLIP in an automated CI test infrastructure. Our initial deployment comprises 22 unique platforms, each of which executes 98 peripheral tests every night. PHiLIP allows for easy extension of low-cost, adaptive testing infrastructures but serves testing techniques and tools to a much wider range of applications.",

  abstract = {BGP Route Flap Damping (RFD) is recommended to suppress BGP churn. Current configuration recommendations for RFD, however, are based on a study from 2010. Since then, BGP churn increased by one order of magnitude, which may lead to outdated RFD parameters and introduce more loss of reachability of stable networks. In this paper, we revisit current recommendations to configure RFD. Our contributions are threefold. First, we successfully reproduce the 2010 measurement study that justified the current RFD recommendations using current data. Second, we consider the RFD implementation of an additional major router vendor (Juniper), which penalizes BGP churn differently compared to the previously studied Cisco implementation. Third, we include IPv6~data from 2020. Our results show that the recommended RFD configuration parameters from 2010, though seemingly rarely used, still hold today in IPv4 and IPv6 and across vendors, even though BGP churn increased significantly. Our study revises metrics to assess the impact of incorrectly configured RFD, discusses collateral damage, and gives insights into sweet spots when damping routes.},

We elaborate this for safety-critical use cases. This paper focuses on the effects of networking protocols for industrial communication services.

Our findings indicate a rather diverse picture with a large dependence on deployment: Publish-subscribe protocols are more versatile, whereas ICN protocols are more robust in multi-hop environments.

It is therefore crucial for the authorities to reduce risks when accessing their online services.
This includes catering to secure identification of service, secure resolution of name to network service, and content security and privacy as a minimum base for trustworthy communication.

In this paper, we take a first look at Alerting Authorities (AA) in the US and investigate security measures related to trustworthy and secure communication.
We study the domain namespace structure, DNSSEC penetration, and web certificates.
We introduce an integrative threat model to better understand whether and how the online presence and services of AAs are harmed.
As an illustrative  example, we investigate 1,388 Alerting Authorities, backed by the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (US FEMA). We observe partial heightened security relative to the global Internet trends, yet find cause for concern as about 80\% of service providers fail to deploy measures of trustworthy service provision.
Our analysis shows two major shortcomings. 
First, how the DNS ecosystem is leveraged: about 50\% of organizations do not own their dedicated domain names and are dependent on others, 55\% opt for unrestricted-use namespaces, which simplifies phishing, and less than 0.4\% of unique AA domain names are secured by DNSSEC, which can lead to DNS poisoning and possibly to certificate misissuance.
Second, how Web PKI certificates are utilized: 15\% of all hosts provide none or invalid certificates, thus cannot cater to confidentiality and data integrity, 64\% of the hosts provide domain validation certification that lack any identity information, and shared certificates have gained on popularity, which leads to fate-sharing and can be a cause for instability.},

ABSTRACT="Vehicular on-board communication is the basis for advanced driver
assistance, autonomous driving, over-the-air updates, and many more. If
unprotected, this infrastructure is vulnerable to manipulation and various
attacks. As any networked system, future connected cars require robust
protection, monitoring, and incidence management against cyber-attacks
during their lifetime. We demonstrate an infrastructure that secures the
in-vehicle communication system and enables the security management of an
entire vehicle fleet. Our prototype - a real-world production car - uses an
Ethernet backbone network. It implements protective measures using
software-defined networking, anomaly detection technologies, and is
connected to a cyber defense center in the cloud. We demonstrate how this
combination can reliably detect and mitigate common attacks on the vehicle
- including its legacy components.",

      ABSTRACT="Current In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) connect Electronic Control Units (ECUs)
via domain busses. A gateway forwards messages between these domains.
Automotive Ethernet emerges as a flat, high-speed backbone technology for
IVNs that carries the various control flows within Ethernet frames.
Recently, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been identified as a useful
building block of the vehicular domain, as it allows the differentiation of
packets based on all header fields and thus can isolate unrelated control
flows.
In this work, we systematically explore the different strategies for
integrating automotive control flows in switched Ether-networks and analyze
their security impact for a software-defined IVN. We discuss how control
flow identifiers can be embedded on different layers resulting in a range
of solutions from fully exposed embedding to deep encapsulation. We
evaluate these strategies in a realistic IVN based on the communication
matrix of a production grade vehicle, which we map into a modern Ethernet
topology. We find that visibility of automotive control flows within packet
headers is essential for the network infrastructure to enable isolation and
access control. With an exposed embedding, the SDN backbone can establish
and survey trust zones within the IVN and largely reduce the attack surface
of connected cars. An exposed embedding strategy also minimizes
communication expenses.",

The Actor model of computation has beenwisely designed to abstract communication between actorsand hence remains transparent w.r.t. distribution. Perfor-mance, security, and deployment considerations, however,make it difficult to define a specific communication trans-port that should be hardcoded into an actor framework. Itis rather desirable to design appropriate transport abstrac-tions, which allow for flexible choices and configurations oftransport functions on the Internet.In this paper, we report about our ongoing work of re-designing, implementing, and evaluating a network stackthat abstracts transport for the C++ Actor Framework (CAF).The stack allows for the exchanging of transport protocolsand adds configuration options as well as compositions ofprotocols. First comparisons of TCP versus UDP with con-figurable reliability options are provided, as well as an earlyevaluation of its performance.},

  abstract  = {The low-power Internet of Things (IoT) introduces lossy radio links with ultra-constrained frame sizes and high transmission cost for each byte. Information Centric Networking (ICN) is considered a promising communication technology in this regime, as it increases reliability by ubiquitous caching and eases transmission efforts by hop-wise forwarding. Common ICN layers such as NDN, however, were designed for fixed network infrastructure and require an adaptation layer to the constrained wireless - as the common Internet Protocol does.

In this paper, we design and evaluate such an ICN convergence layer for low power lossy links that (1) augments the NDN stateful forwarding plane with a highly efficient name eliding, (2) devises stateless compression schemes for standard NDN use cases with utile data encodings, (3) adapts NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4, and (4) generates compatibility with 6LoWPAN so that IPv6 and NDN can coexist on the same LoWPAN links. Our findings indicate that stateful compression can reduce the size of NDN data packets by more than 70 \% in realistic examples, while packet fragmentation operates in a predictable way even for high fragment numbers. Our experiments show that for common use cases ICNLoWPAN saves 33 \% of transmission resources over NDN, and about 20 \% over 6LoWPAN.},

We introduce an algorithmic framework for network tomography, BeCAUSe, which implements Bayesian Computation for Autonomous Systems. Using our original combination of active probing and stochastic simulation, we present the first study to expose the deployment of RFD. In contrast to the expectation of the Internet community, we find that at least 10\% of measured ASs enable RFD, most using deprecated vendor default configuration parameters. To illustrate the power of computational Bayesian methods we compare BeCAUSe with three RFD heuristics. Thereafter we successfully apply a generalization of the Bayesian method to a second challenge, measuring deployment of ROV.},

Surely users care about data, but they also care about trust, accountability, private communication, and everything else that the current Internet provides beside mere content.

Independently, the IETF CoAP  protocol group started to develop mechanisms that support autonomous content processing and in-network storage.

In this paper, we explore the emerging CoAP protocol building blocks and how they contribute to an information-centric network architecture for a data-oriented RESTful Web of Things. We discuss design options and measure characteristic performances of different network configurations, which deploy CoAP proxies and OSCORE content object security, and compare with NDN\@. Our findings indicate an almost continuous design space ranging from plain CoAP at the one end to NDN on the other.  On both ends---ICN and CoAP---we identify protocol features and aspects whose mutual transfer  potentially improves design and operation of  the other. },

We use Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to evaluate anomaly reports, to identify the generating flows, and to ban them from the network.

Inter-connected sensors and actuators have scaled down to small embedded devices such as wearables, and at the same time meet a massive deployment at the Internet edge---the Internet of Things (IoT).
Many of these IoT devices run on low-power batteries and are forced to operate on very constrained resources, namely slow CPUs, tiny memories, and low-power radios.
 Establishing a network infrastructure that is energy efficient, wireless, and still covers a wide area is a larger challenge in this regime.
 LoRa is a low complexity long range radio technology, which tries to meet these challenges.
 With LoRaWAN a network model for widespread deployment has been established, which enjoys open public LoRaWAN dissemination such as with the infrastructure of TheThingsNetwork.

In this paper, we report about our experiences with developing and deploying LoRa-based smart city applications as part of the MONICA project in Hamburg. Our contributions are twofold.
First, we describe the design and implementation of end-to-end IoT applications based on the friendly IoT operating system RIOT.
Second, we report on measurements and evaluations of our large field trials during several public events in the city of Hamburg.
Our results show that LoRaWAN provides a suitable communication layer for a variety of Smart City use-cases and IoT applications, but also identifies its limitations and weaknesses.},

In this paper, we design and analyze a QoS scheme that manages the NDN resources forwarding and queuing priorities, as well as the utilization of caches and of forwarding state space.
  In constrained wireless networks, these resources are scarce with a potentially high impact due to lossy radio transmission.
  We explore the two basic service qualities (i) prompt and (ii) reliable traffic forwarding.
  We treat QoS resources not only in isolation, but correlate their use on local nodes and between network members.
  Network-wide coordination is based on simple QoS code points that can be distributed via a routing protocol.
  Fairness measures that prevent resource starvation are part of this management scheme.
  Our findings indicate that our coordinated QoS management in ICN does not only effectively prioritize the privileged data chunks, but also improves regular data communication.
  We can show that appropriate QoS coordination can enhance the overall network performance by more than the sum of its parts and that it exceeds the impact QoS can have in the IP world.

Protocols such as CoAP or MQTT-SN are weakened by the overhead of DTLS sessions, which in common deployment protect content transfer only up to the gateway.
To preserve end-to-end content security throughout gateways and proxies, the IETF CoRE working group recently developed OSCORE as an extension to CoAP, which adds content object security features commonly known from Information Centric Networks (ICN).

This paper presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protect request-response transactions.
We measure protocol performances of CoAP over DTLS, OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol on a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios.
Our findings indicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wireless regimes due to omitting the  overhead of maintaining security sessions at endpoints, and (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to its intrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions.

ABSTRACT="Natural as well as human-caused disasters and catastrophes easily lead to
chaos. Effective crisis communication and informing the public about the current
situation can reduce chaos and maintain social resiliency. Communication,
however, relies on a working physical infrastructure, which usually is
broken in the incident area. Whereas first response teams and authorities
benefit from special communication equipment, civilians do not and
experience longer periods of being disconnected from the outside world.
Even if messages come through occasionally, the communication is too
intermittent to allow for channel-based trust models. TLS, for example,
requires access to trusted third parties to authenticate data.

In this position paper, we argue that end-to-end communication conflicts
with disaster scenarios. We propose an approach that leverages
information-centric networking (ICN) to authenticate risk and crisis
communication in loosely connected communication systems. Our proposal
makes use of spatiotemporal decoupling of data from their producers based
on ICN for optimal message propagation in fragmented networks, while
introducing a trust bootstrapping phase to enable off-line authentication.
The data-oriented security model of ICN is used to tailor a trust model
specifically for scenarios during which access to trusted third parties or
data owners is not given and messages are relayed
through untrusted parties.",

ABSTRACT="Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is about to enter automotive networks
based on the SOME/IP middleware and an Ethernet high-bandwidth
communication layer. It promises to meet the growing demands on
connectivity and flexibility for software components in modern cars.
Largely heterogeneous service requirements and time-sensitive network
functions make Quality-of-Service (QoS) agreements a vital building block
within future automobiles. Existing middleware solutions, however, do not
allow for a dynamic selection of QoS.
This paper presents a service-oriented middleware along with a
multi-protocol stack, which support the different communication classes as
derived from a thorough requirements analysis. A service protocol for QoS
negotiations is part of our solution. We validate the feasibility of our
approach in a case study and evaluate its performance in a simulation model
of a realistic in-car network. Our findings indicate that QoS aware
communication can indeed meet the requirements, while the impact of the
service negotiations and setup times of the network remain acceptable as
long as the cross-traffic during negotiations stays below 70\% of the
available bandwidth.",

In addition, Information Centric Networking (ICN) offers  resource dimensions such as in-network caches and forwarding state. In constrained wireless networks, these resources are scarce with a potentially high impact due to lossy radio transmission. In this paper, we explore the two basic service qualities (i) prompt and (ii) reliable traffic forwarding for the case of NDN. The resources we take into account are forwarding and queuing priorities, as well as the utilization of caches and of forwarding state space. We treat QoS resources not only in isolation, but correlate their use on local nodes and between network members. Network-wide coordination is based on simple, predefined QoS code points. Our findings indicate that coordinated QoS management in ICN is more than the sum of its parts and exceeds the impact QoS can have in the IP world.},

Remote Triggered Black Hole filtering (RTBH) has been established as a tool to mitigate inter-domain DDoS attacks by discarding unwanted traffic early in the network, e.g., at Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). As of today, little is known about the kind and effectiveness of its use, and about the need for more fine-grained filtering.

In this paper, we present the first in-depth statistical analysis of all RTBH events at a large European IXP by correlating measurements of the data and the control plane for a period of 104 days. We identify a surprising practise that significantly deviates from the expected mitigation use patterns. First, we show that only one third of all 34k visible RTBH events correlate with indicators of DDoS attacks. Second, we witness over 2000 blackhole events announced for prefixes not of servers but of clients situated in DSL networks. Third, we find that blackholing on average causes dropping of only 50\% of the unwanted traffic and is hence a much less reliable tool for mitigating DDoS attacks than expected. Our analysis gives also rise to first estimates of the collateral damage caused by RTBH-based DDoS mitigation.},

Minimal fragment forwarding is challenged by the lack of forwarding information at subsequent fragments in 6LoWPAN and thus requires additional data at nodes. We compare the two approaches in extensive experiments evaluating reliability, end-to-end latency, and memory consumption. In contrast to previous work and due to our alternate setup, we obtained different results and conclusions. Our findings indicate that direct fragment forwarding should be deployed only with care, since higher packet transmission rates on the link-layer can significantly reduce its reliability, which in turn can even further reduce end-to-end latency because of highly increased link-layer retransmissions.},

platforms that optimize limited resources and thus save resources and
increase the quality of living at the same time. Several systems have
evolved in the past to address such issues by providing platforms for
collecting, sharing, and processing urban data. However, these existing
platforms only partially address challenges like fostering the
participation of citizens, protecting their privacy, and assuring certain
levels of quality of information.
In this paper, we present the architecture of SANE as an open,
citizen-centric, scalable, and privacy-preserving smart city platform. SANE
is intended as open platform on which citizens can contribute data but also
hardware, without any central authority or control. Moreover, citizens
maintain full control on their data and its usage. SANE comes with rich and
distributed data analytics functionality that is intended to help citizens
to answer data-related question in the context of smart cities.",

  ABSTRACT="Industrial production plants traditionally include sensors for monitoring or documenting processes, and actuators for enabling corrective actions in
cases of misconfigurations, failures, or dangerous events. With the advent
of the IoT, embedded controllers link these 'things' to local networks that
often are of low power wireless kind, and are interconnected via gateways
to some cloud from the global Internet. Inter-networked sensors and
actuators in the industrial IoT form a critical subsystem while frequently
operating under harsh conditions. It is currently under debate how to
approach inter-networking of critical industrial components in a safe and
secure manner. In this paper, we analyze the potentials of ICN for
providing a secure and robust networking solution for constrained
controllers in industrial safety systems. We showcase hazardous gas sensing
in widespread industrial environments, such as refineries, and compare with
IP-based approaches such as CoAP and MQTT. Our findings indicate that the
content-centric security model, as well as enhanced DoS resistance are
important arguments for deploying Information Centric Networking in a
safety-critical industrial IoT. Evaluation of the crypto efforts on the
RIOT operating system for content security reveal its feasibility for
common deployment scenarios.",

This traffic analysis is correlated with data from honeypots and Internet-wide scans to separate industrial from non-industrial ICS traffic. We provide an in-depth view on Internet-wide ICS communication. Our results can be used (1) to create precise filters for potentially harmful non-industrial ICS traffic, and (2) to detect ICS sending unprotected inter-domain ICS traffic, being vulnerable to eavesdropping and traffic manipulation attacks.},

A new frame format is specified to adapt CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header formats are described. To support compatibility with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching scheme provided by 6LoWPAN is extended to include new dispatch types for CCNx and NDN. Additionally, the link fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to ICN chunks. In its second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links. Stateless compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields for common use cases. Stateful compression schemes elide state local to the LoWPAN and replace names in data packets by short local identifiers.",

  abstract  = {The message-driven nature of actors lays a foundation for developing scalable and distributed software. While the actor itself has been thoroughly modeled, the message passing layer lacks a common definition. Properties and guarantees of message exchange often shift with implementations and contexts. This adds complexity to the development process, limits portability, and  removes transparency from distributed actor systems.

In this work, we examine actor communication, focusing on the implementation and runtime costs of reliable and ordered delivery. Both guarantees are often based on TCP for remote messaging, which mixes network transport with the semantics of messaging. However, the choice of transport may follow different constraints and is often governed by deployment.
As a first step towards decoupling the messaging guarantees from the transport protocol, we present a redesigned network stack in the C++ Actor Framework (CAF) that allows to combine a transport protocol with additional functions for remote messaging. An evaluation quantifies the cost of composability and the impact of individual layers on the entire stack.},

               befindet sich derzeit in einem starken Wandel. Neue
               Anwendungen aus den Bereichen der Fahrerassistenzsysteme
               und des Infotainments sowie insbesondere das automatisierte
               und autonome Fahren haben einen weit h{\"o}heren Bedarf an
               leistungsf{\"a}higen Kommunikationsverbindungen, als die
               bisher im Automobil eingesetzten Technologien garantieren
               k{\"o}nnen. Dies gilt insbesondere f{\"u}r neue Sensorik
               wie beispielsweise Kameras, Radar und Laser-Scanner, welche
               die Umwelt mit einem hohen Detailgrad aufzeichnen und
               daf{\"u}r h{\"o}here Bandbreiten als bisherige Systeme
               {\"u}bertragen m{\"u}ssen. Echtzeit-Ethernet ist die
               favorisierte L{\"o}sung f{\"u}r die Herausforderungen
               zuk{\"u}nftiger Fahrzeugnetzwerke; es wurden jedoch, trotz
               des Bekenntnisses gro{\ss}er Automobilhersteller zu
               Automotive-Ethernet, bisher keine umfassenden und auf
               realistischen Datenverkehrsmodellen basierenden
               Architekturanalysen durchgef{\"u}hrt.

               Die vorliegende Arbeit leistet einen Beitrag zum Design und
               zur Bewertung neuer Ethernet-basierter
               Fahrzeugnetzwerkarchitekturen. Sie liefert Werkzeuge
               f{\"u}r die simulationsbasierte Analyse und Beurteilung von
               Netzwerkarchitekturen und evaluiert anhand konkreter
               Anwendungen, beispielsweise aus dem Bereich der
               Sensorfusion, und realistischer auf realen Verkehrsdaten
               aufbauender Szenarien m{\"o}gliche Netzwerkdesigns und

               Echtzeit-Ethernet-basierten Fahrzeugnetzwerk
               ber{\"u}cksichtigt. Ein schrittweise Migrationspfad ist
               eine wichtige Anforderung f{\"u}r einen erfolgreichen
               Einsatz im Automobil. Auf Basis der hierbei aus
               analytischen Modellen sowie Simulationsstudien und einem
               realen Fahrzeugprototyp gewonnenen Erkenntnisse werden
               Designempfehlungen f{\"u}r die Entwicklung zuk{\"u}nftiger
               Ethernet-basierter Fahrzeugnetzwerke ausgesprochen.

               Methodisch kommt in der vorliegenden Arbeit insbesondere
               die Netzwerksimulation zum Einsatz. F{\"u}r die Bewertung
               neuer Fahrzeugnetzwerkarchitekturen werden Werkzeuge zur
               Simulation und Analyse zuk{\"u}nftiger heterogener
               Echtzeit"=Ethernet"=Backbones entwickelt. Damit stellt die
               Arbeit eine leistungsf{\"a}hige
               Open-Source-Simulationsumgebung f{\"u}r die Analyse
               zuk{\"u}nftiger Fahrzeugnetzwerke bereit, welche in
               Forschung und Entwicklung frei verwendet und
               weiterentwickelt werden kann. Mithilfe eines
               Prototypfahrzeugs werden die in der Simulation sowie in
               analytischen Modellen untersuchten Aspekte in einer realen
               Fahrzeugumgebung {\"u}berpr{\"u}ft. Die Untersuchung im
               Prototyp weist die Realisierbarkeit der entwickelten
               Ans{\"a}tze nach und zeigt auf, an welcher Stelle
               Herausforderungen und Handlungsbedarfe bei der
               Implementierung der entwickelten Konzepte bestehen.

               Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung f{\"u}hren zu
               Designempfehlungen und Best Practices f{\"u}r
               zuk{\"u}nftige Backbone-Netzwerke im Automobil. Diese
               umfassen unter anderem das Kommunikationsdesign, den

               der Designempfehlungen um ein Vielfaches verbessern lassen.},

With the increasing deployment of CT, there are also concerns of information leakage due to all certificates being visible in CT logs. To understand this threat, we introduce a CT honeypot and show that data from CT logs is being used to identify targets for scanning campaigns only minutes after certificate issuance. We present and evaluate a methodology to learn and validate new subdomains from the vast number of domains extracted from CT logged certificates.},

We explain operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and the use of networking.

Such scenarios require high responsiveness and limited control state at the constrained nodes. We argue that the NDN request-response pattern which prevents data push is vital for IoT networks. We contribute HoP-and-Pull (HoPP), a robust publish-subscribe scheme for typical IoT scenarios that targets IoT networks consisting of hundreds of resource constrained devices at intermittent connectivity. Our approach limits the FIB tables to a minimum and naturally supports mobility, temporary network partitioning, data aggregation and near real-time reactivity. We experimentally evaluate the protocol in a real-world deployment using the IoT-Lab testbed with varying numbers of constrained devices, each wirelessly interconnected via IEEE 802.15.4 LowPANs. Implementations are built on CCN-lite with RIOT and support experiments using various single- and multi-hop scenarios.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly evolving based on low-power compliant protocol standards that extend the Internet into the embedded world. Pioneering implementations have proven it is feasible to inter-network very constrained devices, but had to rely on peculiar cross-layered designs and offer a minimalistic set of features. In the long run, however, professional use and massive deployment of IoT devices require full-featured, cleanly composed, and flexible network stacks.

This paper introduces the networking architecture that turns RIOT into a powerful IoT system, to enable low-power wireless scenarios. RIOT networking offers (i) a modular architecture with generic interfaces for plugging in drivers, protocols, or entire stacks, (ii) support for multiple heterogeneous interfaces and stacks that can concurrently operate, and (iii) GNRC, its cleanly layered, recursively composed default network stack. We contribute an in-depth analysis of the communication performance and resource efficiency of RIOT, both on a micro-benchmarking level as well as by comparing IoT communication across different platforms. Our findings show that, though it is based on significantly different design trade-offs, the networking subsystem of RIOT achieves a performance equivalent to that of Contiki and TinyOS, the two operating systems which pioneered IoT software platforms.},

While some networks now specify ROAs, little is known about whether other networks check routes they receive against these ROAs, a process known as Route Origin Validation (ROV). Which networks blindly accept invalid routes? Which reject them outright? Which de-preference them if alternatives exist?
Recent analysis attempts to use uncontrolled experiments to characterize ROV adoption by comparing valid routes and invalid routes. However, we argue that gaining a solid understanding of ROV adoption is impossible using currently available data sets and techniques. Our measurements suggest that, although some ISPs are not observed using invalid routes in uncontrolled experiments, they are actually using different routes for (non-security) traffic engineering purposes, without performing ROV. We conclude with a description of a controlled, verifiable methodology for measuring ROV and present three ASes that do implement ROV, confirmed by operators.},

choosing a random victim scheduling is kept simple with minimal information required.
On the downside, it ignores  data locality and misses opportunities to improve the application performance.

In this paper, we contribute a locality-guided scheduling that exploits knowledge about the host system to adapt runtime deployment and thereby improves the performance of actor based applications.
We implement and thoroughly analyze a CAF scheduler which considers the trade-off between \emph{communication locality} and \emph{execution locality}.
The former describes the locality of communicating actors, while the latter the locality between a worker, which executes an actor, and the location of its data.
Extensive performance evaluations show a performance gain for data intensive application of up to 25\% on a 64 core NUMA machine.},

Second, current link layer technologies are completely ICN agnostic, which prevents filtering of ICN packets at the device driver level. Consequently, any ICN packet, Interest as well as data, is processed by the CPU. This sacrifices local system resources and disregards link layer support functions such as wireless retransmission. We argue for a mapping of names to MAC addresses to efficiently handle ICN packets, and start exploring dynamic face-based mapping schemes. We analyze the impact of this link-layer adaptation in real-world experiments and quantitatively compare to different configurations. Our findings on processing, reliability, and energy consumptions on constrained devices indicate significant gains in larger networks.},

In this context, an IoT approach based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) offers prospects for low energy consumption. Indeed, ICN can provide local in-network content caching so that relevant IoT content remains available at any time while devices are in deep-sleep mode most of the time. In this paper, we evaluate NDN enhanced with CoCa, a simple side protocol we designed to exploit content names together with smart interplay between cooperative caching and power-save sleep capabilities on IoT devices. We perform extensive, large scale experiments on real hardware with IoT networks comprising of up to 240 nodes, and on an emulator with up to 1000 nodes. We show in practice that, with NDN+CoCa, devices can reduce energy consumption by an order of magnitude while maintaining recent IoT content availability above 90~\%. We furthermore provide auto-configuration mechanisms enabling practical ICN deployments on IoT networks of arbitrary size with NDN+CoCa. With such mechanisms, each device can autonomously configure names and auto-tune parameters to reduce energy consumption as demonstrated in this paper.},

 ABSTRACT="In the IoT, the trade-off between content availability and energy
efficiency plays a crucial role. The standard approach to energy efficiency
in the IoT combines low-power radios, network protocols letting devices
sleep most of the time, and centralized caching of content, either at a
designated proxy or in the cloud via an uplink, which maintains IoT content
availability while devices sleep. However, this approach is not possible in
a number of IoT scenarios, where a designated gateway/proxy is unavailable
most of the time. In this paper, we propose an approach leveraging
distributed caching for IoT content, based on an information-centric
networking paradigm. We extend the NDN protocol with a variety of caching
and replacement strategies, and we discuss alternative approaches for
extending NDN to accommodate such IoT use cases. Based on extensive
experiments on real IoT hardware in a network gathering hundreds of nodes,
we demonstrate these caching strategies can bring 90\% reduction in energy
consumption while maintaining IoT content availability above 90\%.",

 The Internet routing protocol BGP expresses topological reachability and policy-based decisions simultaneously in path vectors. A complete view on the Internet backbone routing is given by the collection of all valid routes, which is infeasible to obtain due
to information hiding of BGP, the lack of omnipresent collection points, and data complexity. Commonly, graph-based data models are used to represent the Internet topology from a given set of BGP routing tables but fall short of explaining policy contexts. As
a consequence, routing anomalies such as route leaks and interception attacks cannot be explained with graphs.
In this paper, we use formal languages to represent the global routing system in a rigorous model. Our CAIR framework translates BGP announcements into a finite route language that allows for the incremental construction of minimal route automata. CAIR
preserves route diversity, is highly efficient, and well-suited to monitor BGP path changes in real-time. We formally derive implementable search patterns for route leaks and interception attacks. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we can detect these
incidents. In practical experiments, we analyze public BGP data over the last seven years.

  over the last decade. Its high level of abstraction  makes it appealing for
  concurrent applications in parallel and distributed systems. However,
  designing a real-world actor framework that subsumes full scalability, strong
  reliability, and high resource efficiency requires  many conceptual and
  algorithmic additives to the original model.

  In this paper, we report on designing and building CAF, the C++ Actor
  Framework.  CAF targets at providing a  concurrent and distributed native
  environment for scaling up to very large, high-performance applications, and
  equally well down to small constrained systems. We present the key
  specifications and design concepts---in particular a message-transparent
  architecture, type-safe message interfaces, and pattern matching
  facilities---that make native actors a viable approach for many robust,
  elastic, and highly distributed developments. We demonstrate the feasibility
  of CAF in three scenarios: first for elastic, upscaling environments, second
  for including heterogeneous hardware like GPUs, and third for distributed
  runtime systems.  Extensive performance evaluations indicate ideal runtime
  behavior for up to 64 cores at very low memory footprint, or in the presence
  of GPUs.  In these tests, CAF continuously outperforms the competing actor
  environments Erlang, Charm++, SalsaLite, Scala, ActorFoundry, and even the
  raw message passing framework OpenMPI.},

  abstract = {Web content delivery is one of the most important services on the
              Internet. Access to websites is typically secured via TLS. However,
              this security model does not account for prefix hijacking on the
              network layer, which may lead to traffic blackholing or transparent
              interception. Thus, to achieve comprehensive security and service
              availability, additional protective mechanisms are necessary such
              as the RPKI, a recently deployed Resource Public Key Infrastructure
              to prevent hijacking of traffic by networks. This paper argues two
              positions. First, that modern web hosting practices make route
              protection challenging due to the propensity to spread servers
              across many different networks, often with unpredictable client
              redirection strategies; and, second, that we need a better
              understanding why protection mechanisms are not deployed. To
              initiate this, we empirically explore the relationship between web
              hosting infrastructure and RPKI deployment. Perversely, we find
              that less popular websites are more likely to be secured than the
              prominent sites. Worryingly, we find many large-scale CDNs do not
              support RPKI, thus making their customers vulnerable. This leads
              us to explore business reasons why operators are hesitant to deploy
              RPKI, which may help to guide future research on improving Internet
              security.},

               processing units (GPUs) or coprocessors is increasingly available
               for general-purpose computation. The seamless way of actor systems
               to addresses concurrent and distributed programming makes it an
               attractive approach to integrate these novel architectures. In
               this work, we introduce OpenCL-enabled actors to the C++ Actor
               Framework (CAF). This offers a high level interface for accessing
               any OpenCL device without leaving the actor  paradigm. The new
               type of actor is integrated into the runtime environment of CAF
               and gives rise to transparent message passing in distributed
               systems  on heterogeneous hardware. New actors are instantiated
               by the function spawn\_cl, while the runtime environment handles
               the discovery and setup of OpenCL devices in the background. Our
               evaluations on a commodity GPU, an Nvidia TESLA, and an Intel PHI

 channel to enable services such as advanced metering, demand side management, and
 virtual power plants. The Internet is able to host these highly distributed
 communication demands, leading the Smart Grid to become an Internet-dependent
 critical national infrastructure. In this work, we introduce a nation-centric
 perspective and methodology to shed light on performance and robustness of
 Internet-based Smart Grid communication. By presenting a case study for Germany,
 our contributions are: (a) we apply new methods to identify all stakeholders of
 the energy sector within a national Internet topology, (b) we analyze
 vulnerabilities of the corresponding communication (sub-)system as part of the
 current Internet, and (c) we extend our analysis to include Internet access,
 networks of consumer households, where most Smart Grid applications will be
 implemented. Our findings indicate that the energy-related Internet subsystems
 are up to 2-times more robust to network failures than the national average.
 Further, Internet connectivity of consumers households achieves availability
 of >\,99\,\% and is therefore suitable for most Smart Grid applications.},

                  technology of future in-car communication networks.
                  Following its current adoption in subsystems for info- and
                  entertainment, broadband Ethernet promises new features in
                  the core of upcoming car series. Its full potential will
                  enfold when deploying Ethernet-based backbones that
                  consolidate all automotive domains on a single physical
                  layer at increased bandwidth but reduced complexity and
                  cost. In such a backbone, traffic with a variety of
                  real-time requirements and best-effort characteristics will
                  share the same physical infrastructure. However, certain
                  applications like online diagnosis, data- or firmware
                  updates, and access to off-board backends will introduce
                  bursty high traffic loads to the sensitive core of the cars
                  communication network. In this work, we analyze the
                  robustness against cross-traffic of real-time Ethernet
                  protocols. Based on a realistic in-car scenario, we
                  demonstrate that background cross-traffic can have
                  significant impact on in-car backbone networks---even for
                  real-time protocols with strict prioritization. By
                  comparing the real-time approaches Ethernet AVBs
                  asynchronous credit based shaping with the time-triggered
                  and rate-constrained traffic classes of Time-triggered
                  Ethernet (AS6802) we quantify how different media access
                  policies suffer from low priority bursts of applications
                  such as diagnosis, online updates or backend-based
                  services. Our simulation study of a realistic in-car
                  backbone design and traffic model reveals that in a
                  realistic in-car network design, cross-traffic may increase
                  end-to-end latency by more than 500\% while the jitter can
                  become 14 times higher than for a network without

The Great Cannon DDoS attack has shown that HTML/JavaScript can be used to launch HTTP-based DoS attacks. In this paper, we identify options that could allow the implementation of the general idea of browser-based DDoS botnets and review ways how attackers can
acquire bots (e.g., typosquatting and malicious ads). We then assess the DoS impact of browser features and show that at least three JavaScript-based techniques can orchestrate clients to send thousands of HTTP requests per second. Seeing the vats potential,
we evaluate the economics of browser-based botnets and show that their cost are about as high as traditional DDoS botnets--while giving far less flexibility in terms of attack features and control over the bots. Finally, we discuss victim- and browser-side

selection of different proposals for detecting and preventing amplification attacks, as well as proposals for tracing the attackers. Since source IP spoofing plays an important part in almost all of the attacks mentioned, a survey on the state of the art in
spoofing defenses is also presented. This work acts as an introduction into amplification attacks and source IP address spoofing. By combining previous works into a single comprehensive bibliography, and with our concise discussion, we hope to prevent
redundant work and encourage others to find practical solutions for defending against future amplification attacks.

The vulnerability of the Internet has been demonstrated by prominent IP prefix hijacking events. Major outages such as the China Telecom incident in 2010 stimulate speculations about malicious intentions behind such anomalies. Surprisingly, almost all
discussions in the current literature assume that hijacking incidents are enabled by the lack of security mechanisms in the inter-domain routing protocol BGP.

In this paper, we discuss an attacker model that accounts for the hijacking of network ownership information stored in Regional Internet Registry (RIR) databases. We show that such threats emerge from abandoned Internet resources (e.g., IP address blocks, AS
numbers). When DNS names expire, attackers gain the opportunity to take resource ownership by re-registering domain names that are referenced by corresponding RIR database objects. We argue that this kind of attack is more attractive than conventional
hijacking, since the attacker can act in full anonymity on behalf of a victim. Despite corresponding incidents have been observed in the past, current detection techniques are not qualified to deal with these attacks. We show that they are feasible with very
little effort, and analyze the risk potential of abandoned Internet resources for the European service region: our findings reveal that currently 73 /24 IP prefixes and 7 ASes are vulnerable to be stealthily abused. We discuss countermeasures and outline
research directions towards preventive solutions.

Web content delivery is one of the most important services on the Internet. Access to websites is typically secured via TLS. However, this security model does not account for prefix hijacking on the network layer, which may lead to traffic blackholing or
transparent interception. Thus, to achieve comprehensive security and service availability, additional protective mechanisms are necessary such as the RPKI, a recently deployed Resource Public Key Infrastructure to prevent hijacking of traffic by networks.
This paper argues two positions. First, that modern web hosting practices make route protection challenging due to the propensity to spread servers across many different networks, often with unpredictable client redirection strategies, and, second, that we
need a better understanding why protection mechanisms are not deployed. To initiate this, we empirically explore the relationship between web hosting infrastructure and RPKI deployment. Perversely, we find that less popular websites are more likely to be
secured than the prominent sites. Worryingly, we find many large-scale CDNs do not support RPKI, thus making their customers vulnerable. This leads us to explore business reasons why operators are hesitant to deploy RPKI, which may help to guide future
research on improving Internet security.

CAF targets at providing an extremely scalable native environment for building high-performance concurrent applications and distributed systems. Based on our previous library {\tt libcppa}, CAF significantly extends its scopes of application and operation, as well as the range of scalability.
The particular contributions of this paper are threefold. First we present the design and implementation of a type-safe messaging interface for actors that rules out a category of runtime errors and facilitates robust software design. Second we introduce a runtime inspection shell as a first building block for convenient debugging of distributed actors. Finally we enhance the scheduling facilities and improve scaling up to high numbers of concurrent processors. Extensive performance evaluations indicate ideal runtime behaviour for up to 64 cores at very low memory footprint. In these tests, CAF clearly outperforms competing actor environments.",

  abstract      = {The increasing complexity of automotive networks, their
                  challenging timing constraints and their high bandwidth
                  demands require new concepts for future in-car
                  communication. Real-time Ethernet is meant to be a suitable
                  candidate for the next-generation in-car interconnection.
                  However, model-based testing capabilities must be available
                  as well. Applications must be validated prior the first
                  assembly, due to the distributed development process.
                  Methods like residual bus simulation are of particular
                  interest to allow for testing systems in early development
                  stages by emulating unfinished or not available parts of
                  the system. In this paper, we present a methodology and a
                  feasibility study of a residual bus simulation in
                  automotive real-time Ethernet systems. The challenges of
                  applying this testing method in real-time Ethernet based
                  networks with parallel packet transmission are outlined and
                  compared to today's automotive bus system simulation
                  approaches. Furthermore, the combination of different
                  model-based testing techniques, that are not used in
                  state-of-the-art commercial tools, are applied for the
                  validation of non-functional timing requirements. An
                  extension to an existing abstract test case model is
                  proposed, which allows modelling temporal attributes. It is
                  simultaneously used as simulation model to drive the
                  residual bus simulation. We demonstrate the approach's
                  feasibility by implementing a prototype residual bus
                  simulator for real-time Ethernet networks and applying it

In this paper, we contribute a mapping of the time-triggered network scheduling problem into the domain of multiprocessor scheduling. This set of transformation rules allows us to apply established scheduling algorithms as well as new strategies to organise time-triggered switched networks. Experimental results from a prototype implementation of a scheduling framework based on this mapping show the feasibility of our concept. The framework demonstrates a multiple solver approach that uses algorithms with different optimality criteria in parallel.},

Implementing time-triggered architectures in software requires significant development effort and computational power. This paper shows a scalable HW/SW co-design approach for new real-time Ethernet controllers based on the partitioning into communication and application components. The tasks required for communication are divided: Time-critical and computationally intensive parts are realised in dedicated hardware modules allowing the attached CPU to fulfil the timing requirements of the automotive application without interference. The evaluation using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based prototype implementation shows that the precision for the time-triggered transmission and the performance of the proposed implementation of the required synchronisation protocols satisfies the requirements of applications in the automotive domain.},

In this environment, users face the problem of heterogeneous and fluctuating network conditions. A promising solution to this issue is the scalable video coding (SVC). It allows an adaptation of the video stream to the available bandwidth, but requires a reliable bandwidth estimation. Adaptation times for conversational video at fluctuating network conditions are critical, and a fast strategy for bandwidth estimation  is needed to avoid congestion.
In this work, we analyse the capabilities of the sender and the receiver to adapt the video coding to changing network conditions. We derive an early congestion indicator at the sender side based on the jitter variation. For receivers, we use sustained goodput to extract a feasible scaling. In thorough evaluations that include real-world 3G networks, we reveal a faster congestion detection at the sender that are also more robust but less accurate than probing at the receiver.},

However, the distributed processing paradigms we find in practice today fail to provide this requirement: the batch-oriented nature of MapReduce cannot deliver sub-second round-trip times, and distributed in-memory processing cannot store the terabytes of activity logs needed to inspect during an incident.
We present the design and implementation of Visibility Across Space and Time~(VAST), a distributed database to support interactive network forensics, and libcppa, its exceptionally scalable messaging core. The extended actor framework libcppa enables VAST to  distribute lightweight tasks at negligible overhead.

Based on several data sets and scoring functions, we search for the specific characteristics of circles.

While the internal connectivity of circles and communities appear fairly similar, circles admit a much enhanced intensity of external relations.

   technical implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast
   data distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest
   available layer, but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast
   technologies throughout the Internet requires an adaptive service
   binding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write an application
   that runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most

   robustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to use a
   stable upper-layer protocol provided by the application itself.  This
   document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for
   transparent communication in underlay and overlay and that grants
   access to the different flavors of multicast.  It proposes an
   abstract naming scheme that uses multicast URIs, and it discusses
   mapping mechanisms between different namespaces and distribution
   technologies.  Additionally, this document describes the application
   of this API for building gateways that interconnect current Multicast

However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with an Ethernet-based backbone, unifying several automotive domains in a single infrastructure. Today, there is remarkable interest in the IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) protocol suite, that provides end-to-end performance guarantees in Ethernet networks. But for the strict timing requirements of automotive control-traffic, these guarantees are too weak. An extension of Ethernet AVB with synchronous time-triggered traffic can overcome these limitations.
In this paper, we investigate the coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous traffic by experimentally adding time-triggered messages to the credit-based shaper of AVB in a straightforward way. Based on simulations and analytical evaluations, we quantify the impact of such integration concepts for a reasonable design range. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a shaping strategy with concurrent AVB and time-triggered message, but show a significant impact of the schedule design on the asynchronous AVB streams. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for configurations that can improve end-to-end network performance for in-car applications by over 100 \%.},

  ABSTRACT="Users eager to publish content on the Web need to either set up a server or
use third-party infrastructure. However, the increasing desire to use the
Web as a sharing platform for content demands solutions that counter
disadvantages of centralized or restricted platforms. Recent efforts are
underway at the IETF and W3C to standardize WebRTC for direct
browser-to-browser communication. This paper introduces BOPlish, an
infrastructure-independent naming and content access architecture for
sharing information in User Networks. We demonstrate how BOPlish leverages
WebRTC for an easy to use, secure content publishing solution. A custom URI
scheme serves as a location-independent addressing mechanism to separate
publishing and content retrieval from the underlying infrastructure.",

A major step towards secure Internet backbone routing started with the
 deployment of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). It allows
 for the cryptographic strong binding of an IP prefix and autonomous
 systems that are legitimate to originate this prefix. A fundamental
 design choice of RPKI-based prefix origin validation is the avoidance
 of cryptographic load at BGP routers. Cryptographic verifications will
 be performed only by cache servers, which deliver valid AS/prefix
 mappings to the RPKI-enabled BGP router using the RPKI/RTR protocol.

In this paper, we give first insights into the additional system load
 introduced by RPKI at BGP routers. For this purpose, we design and
 implement a highly efficient C library of the RPKI/RTR router part and
 the prefix origin validation scheme. It fetches and stores validated
 prefix origin data from an RTR-cache and performs origin verification
 of prefixes as obtained from BGP updates. We measure a relatively small
 overhead of origin validation on commodity hardware (5\% more RAM than
 required for full BGP table support, 0.41\% load in case of ca. 92,000
 prefix updates per minute), which meets real-world requirements of today.

  ABSTRACT = {With the widespread use of multimedia contents via mobile nodes (MNs), IP mobile multicast becomes more important for wireless, mobile, and ubiquitous multimedia applications. Until now, many research efforts have been made to provide IP multicast for the MNs. However, the existing mobile multicast schemes mostly focus on the mobility of receivers based on the host-based mobility solution that requires the MN to participate in the mobility management. Recent work has shown that service connectivity for mobile multicast sources is still a problem and attracts very little concern. With the development of the network-based mobility support protocol, mobile multicast source support schemes in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) networks are needed urgently. In this paper, we propose a base solution (BS) and also a direct multicast routing scheme (DMRS) for mobile multicast source support in PMIPv6 networks. In the BS, the multicast listener discover (MLD) proxy function is adopted to transmit multicast data through the PMIPv6 tunnel. The DMRS can provide locally optimized traffic flows and avoid inefficient routing present in the BS. We evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed schemes with the Mobile IP bidirectional tunneling (MIP-BT) and Mobile IP remote subscription (MIP-RS) schemes by theoretical analysis and also implement the proposed schemes on the test-bed. The numerical results show that the BS and DMRS outperform the MIP-BT and MIP-RS in terms of signaling cost. Meanwhile, the experimental results verify the feasibility and validity of our proposed schemes. Furthermore, we study the optimal PMIPv6 domain size to reduce the total signaling cost for the proposed schemes.},

It applies to concurrency as well as distribution, and a lightweight actor model implementation that schedules all actors in a properly pre-dimensioned thread pool can outperform equivalent thread-based applications. However, the actor model did not enter the domain of native programming languages yet besides vendor-specific island solutions.

Mobile nodes, in particular smartphones are one of the most relevant devices
 in the current Internet in terms of quantity and economic impact. There is
 the common believe that those devices are of special interest for attackers
 due to their limited resources and the serious data they store. On the other
 hand, the mobile regime is a very lively network environment, which misses
 the (limited) ground truth we have in commonly connected Internet nodes. In
 this paper we argue for a simple long-term measurement infrastructure that
 allows for (1) the analysis of unsolicited traffic to and from mobile devices
 and (2) fair comparison with wired Internet access. We introduce the design
 and implementation of a mobile honeypot, which is deployed on standard hardware
 for more than 1.5 years. Two independent groups developed the same concept for
 the system. We also present preliminary measurement results.

This paper focuses on simulation based timing analyses for FlexRay communication. Based on different scenarios the practical relevance will be shown. The performance results, given in this paper, promise that our simulation approach is a good building block for the simulation of complete, heterogeneous communication matrices in premium cars.",

Popular commercial simulators use dedicated real-time simulation platforms, that are specifically designed for cluster simulation and require expensive hardware. Nevertheless, these systems are mostly inflexible and not designed for the simulation of design changes on the deployed protocol itself.
We contribute an open architecture for the simulation of real-time Ethernet based distributed systems, that bases on OMNeT++, an discrete event-based simulation framework, interconnected with an ARM9-based system-on-chip co-processor. Our approach was evaluated by co-simulation of a real-world time-triggered Ethernet with virtual components running in simulation. Further we evaluated the limits of the system when running on COTS-Hardware. The results show that using a standard Linux system with real-time Kernel patch our requirements for the cluster simulation in the automotive domain can be achieved.",

It allows to track errors at the earliest time -- during the design and configuration -- of a synchronised distributed real-time system. High precision time synchronisation protocols are of vital importance for the safety in cyber-physical systems such as trains, planes, cars or industrial installations. Especially for time-triggered systems, with a coordinated time division multiple access media allocation strategy, the achievable precision of time synchronisation among sending participants determines the quality of communication and the amount of bandwidth that is usable.
In this work we show a new concept for the simulation of distributed real-time synchronisation protocols that uses discrete event-based simulation. Our model for the OMNeT++ Framework is adaptable and thus allows to provide highly accurate results or fast simulations. We show based on the simulation of the AS6802 standard for time-synchronisation typical real-world use cases for the introduced concept. Our results show that the simulation can help to reduce the effort of determining configuration parameters for clock synchronisation protocols. We further show how the simulation of synchronised networks can benefit from our evolutionary approach.",

It applies to concurrency as well as distribution, and a lightweight actor model implementation that schedules all actors in a properly pre-dimensioned thread pool can outperform equivalent thread-based applications. However, the actor model did not enter the domain of native programming languages yet besides vendor-specific island solutions.

distribution of real-time data for IPTV, multimedia conferencing, or

global Internet. Hybrid solutions that bridge between overlay and underlay
multicast are a promising escape from the deployment dilemma of multicast.
In this paper, we examine the real-time capabilities of hybrid multicast
in a globally distributed environment based on our adaptive architecture
HAMcast within the Planet-Lab testbed. We present a large-scale measurement
study and analysis of one-way packet delay distributions in several realistic
group scenarios. The unique results in global traces of hybrid multicast data
have been achieved by carefully tracking packets and continuously correcting
clock offsets. Companion measurements of unicast-based distribution are part
of our analysis, as well as the comparative discussion of our results with
previous findings from theory and simulation. Our measurements reveal that
about 50\% of global group members experience a real-time compliant
service within the conversational time bounds of 150ms.},

  abstract  = {Prefix hijacking has always been a big concern in the Internet. Some events made it into the international world-news, but most of them remain unreported or even unnoticed. The scale of the problem can only be estimated. The Resource Publication Infrastructure (RPKI) is an effort by the IETF to secure the inter-domain routing system. It includes a formally verifiable way of identifying who owns legitimately which portion of the IP address space. The RPKI has been standardized and prototype implementations are tested by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Currently the system holds already about 2\% of the Internet routing table. Therefore, in theory, it should be easy to detect hijacking of prefixes within that address space. We take an early look at BGP update data and check those updates against the RPKI in the same way a router would do, once the system goes operational. We find many interesting dynamics, not all can be easily explained as hijacking, but a significant number are likely operational testing or misconfigurations.},

  abstract  = {Ethernet-based in-car communication is currently a hot topic in the automotive industry. Soon Ethernet will start to oust  MOST bus in its domain of info- and entertainment applications. However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with the deployment of an Ethernet-based backbone that integrates all automotive domains on a single layer at increased bandwidth, reduced complexity and cost, while opening car intelligence for future innovations. Such backbone must transport critical control data in real-time. Standard Ethernet requires extensions to comply to the strict timing requirements of driver assistance and safety applications while simultaneously supporting broadband multimedia traffic. In this paper, we compare IEEE 802.1 AVB and Time-triggered Ethernet, two competing real-time approaches. While the first fosters over-provisioning and prioritisation, the second is based on a {\em coordinated} time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) policy for media access. By simulating a realistic in-car backbone design and traffic model, we reveal the strengths and weaknesses of both protocols and point to the diverging characteristics of event- and time-triggered policies. Our results show that in this in-car network scenario both protocols are able to meet the rigid timing requirements, while each has its unique benefits and disadvantages.},

Our contribution (a) identifies the ASes that are important for the country, (b) classifies these ASes into functional sectors, (c) constructs the AS routing graph of a country as well as subgraphs of specific sectors, and (d) analyzes structural dependencies between key players. Our methods indicate the importance of examining individual IP-blocks held by individual organizations, as this reveals 25\% more stakeholders compared to only looking at prefixes. We quantify the centrality of ASes with respect to specific sectors and the robustness of communication communities. Our results show that members of sectoral groups tend to avoid direct peering, but inter-connect via a small set of common ISPs.

We show that our temporally scaled video codec DSVC has the same RD performance as the non-scaled version with comparable configuration. We achieve this by QP cascading, i.e., assigning gradually refining quantization parameters to the declining temporal layers. The different quantization of frames does not lead to visually distinguishable quality fluctuations. We also present and analyze a mobile-compliant version of DSVC at reduced complexity that still admits comparable performance. Finally, we report on early work of dynamic layer tuning. Derived of delay variation measures, senders exploit scalable video layering to adapt the video transmission to varying network conditions.

  abstract = {IPTV, software replication, and other large scale content distribution services urge the need for fast and efficient content delivery mechanisms in underlay as well as overlay networks. Multicast, the natural approach on the network layer, has not been deployed globally, and solutions are pushed to the application layer. For a flexible, sustainable deployment the distribution mechanisms in use should scale up to many thousand group members and provide predictable performance to dynamically adjust to actual performance requirements. In this paper, we present a rigorous analytical model complemented by extensive simulations for content delivery on prefix-based overlay trees. We examine BIDIR-SAM, a generic multicast distribution scheme guided by prefixes that allow for late next-hop binding.  Our evaluation quantitatively substantiates all major performance aspects. We derive the distribution functions of hop counts, packet replication loads, as well as all relevant cost measures, which scale logarithmically with network and receiver sizes. Prefix-based content delivery exhibits a churn resistance similar to the underlying key-based routing layer and a multicast efficiency scaling factor close to native group communication protocols. These results make the approach especially suitable for large and very large content groups.},

      technical implementations at different protocol layers. Multicast data
      distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest available

      Today, it is difficult to write an application that runs everywhere and
      at the same time makes use of the most efficient multicast service

      frequently forced to use a stable, upper layer protocol provided by the

      is suitable for transparent communication in underlay and overlay, and
      grants access to the different multicast flavors. It proposes an
      abstract naming by multicast URIs and discusses mapping mechanisms

An AS abstracts one or multiple IP networks, which may be globally distributed, but is owned by an organization located in a country.  Current research on the Internet structure mainly focuses on a global perspective or considers local, intra-domain properties. In this paper, we analyze nation-centric subsets of the Internet taken from the AS-level graph of Germany.
Each subset reflects a public or industrial sector. Based on a classified set of relevant German ASes, we are able to perform detailed investigations of structural dependencies for the critical Internet infrastructure. We identify and visualize the importance of dedicated ASes within specific sectors, and quantify robustness of the communication communities. Our preliminary results indicate that members of sectoral groups tend to ovoid direct peering, but connect via a small group of common ISPs. This results in an enhanced dependence (betweenness) on selected hubs as compared to the characteristics of larger networks.},

However, this tightly shaped concept failed to promote a heterogeneous network layer (including IPv6) or additional services like multicast. In this paper, we propose methods for diversifying the Internet service capabilities with the help of enhanced end system intelligence and an API abstraction towards the applications. We provide a general architecture for the example of hybrid adaptive mobile multicast (HAMcast) which allows for various realizations and pluralistic deployments. The achievement of our contribution is a universal, robust service access that allows group applications to run everywhere, no matter what the status of regional technological deployment will be. ",

  abstract = {Modularization and granulation are key concepts in educational content management, whereas teaching, learning and understanding require a discourse within thematic contexts. Even though hyperlinks and semantically typed references provide the context building blocks of hypermedia systems, elaborate concepts to derive, manage and propagate such relations between content objects are not around at present. Based on Semantic Web standards, this paper makes several contributions to content enrichment. Work starts from harvesting multimedia annotations in class-room recordings, and proceeds to deriving a dense educational semantic net between eLearning Objects decorated with extended LOM relations. Special focus is drawn on the processing of recorded speech and on an Ontological Evaluation Layer that autonomously derives meaningful inter-object relations. Further on, a semantic representation of hyperlinks is developed and elaborated to the concept of semantic link contexts, an approach to manage a coherent rhetoric of linking. These solutions have been implemented in the Hypermedia Learning Objects System (hylOs), our eLearning content management system. hylOs is built upon the more general Media Information Repository (MIR) and the MIR adaptive context linking environment (MIRaCLE), its linking extension. MIR is an open system supporting the standards XML and JNDI. hylOs benefits from configurable information structures, sophisticated access logic and high-level authoring tools like the WYSIWYG XML editor and its Instructional Designer.},

Regrettably, overlay traffic is not optimal with respect to native connections and peering agreements, but may decrease network quality at end users at increased transit costs. This issue has been addressed by traffic localization approaches: The general objective is to keep overlay traffic local and to minimize provider crossing. Current efforts foster provider-assisted solutions. Overlays, which approximate  network paths from the underlay, promise to significantly limit inter-domain traffic. However, ISPs offering transits rejoice in additional traffic and may provide localization data to de-localize peers. In this paper, we argue that ISP interaction should be provided by neutral authorities, namely the Internet exchange points. We present an architecture which serves unstructured and structured overlay peers with a sloppy generic overlay ID that jointly reflects AS-paths and peering topologies, and is unbiased by unilateral ISP interests.",

applications to access multicast.  These developments follow  a continuous
debate about network layer multicast that had lasted for about 30 years

Second,  we perform a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining  the different distribution trees  constructed on top of a key-based routing layer. Characteristic performance measures of the multicast approaches are compared in detail and major structural differences are identified.
Overlay multicast overcomes deployment problems on the price of a
performance penalty. Hybrid approaches, which dynamically combine multicast
in overlay and underlay, adaptively optimize group communication. We
discuss current schemes along with its integration in common multicast

  abstract = "The submission of datagrams from a node to a group of receivers must be seen as a powerful extension of the Internet routing layer (Deering, 1989). Multicast group communication forms an integral building block of a wide variety of applications, ranging from public content distribution and streaming over voice and video conferencing, collaborative environments and gaming up to the self-organization of distributed systems. Its support by network layer multicast will be needed, whenever globally distributed, scalable, serverless or instantaneous communication is required. As broadband media delivery more and more emerges to be a typical mass scenario, scalability and bandwidth efficiency of multicast routing continuously gains relevance. Internet multicasting will be of particular importance to mobile environments, where users commonly share frequency bands of limited capacity. The rapidly increasing mobile reception of 'infotainment' streams may soon require a wide deployment of mobile multicast services.
The fundamental approach to deal with mobility in the next generation Internet is stated in the Mobile IPv6 RFC (Johnson, Perkins \& Arkko, 2004). Multicast has only roughly been treated therein, but raises quite distinctive aspects within a mobility aware Internet infrastructure. On the one hand multicast routing itself supports dynamic route configuration, as members may join and leave ongoing group communication over time. On the other hand multicast group membership management and routing procedures are intricate and too slow to function smoothly for mobile users. In addition multicast imposes a special focus on source addresses. Applications commonly identify contributing streams through source addresses, which must not change during sessions, and routing paths in most protocols are chosen from destination to source.
Mobile multicast has been a concern for about ten years (Xylomenos \& Polyzos, 1997) and led to innumerous proposals for solutions. Intricate multicast routing procedures, though, are not easily extensible to comply with mobility requirements. Any client subscribed to a group while in motion, requires delivery branches to pursue its new location; any mobile source requests the entire delivery tree to adapt to its changing positions. Significant effort has been already invested in protocol designs for mobile multicast receivers. Only limited work has been dedicated to multicast source mobility, which poses the more delicate problem (Romdhani, et al., 2004a). In multimedia conference scenarios each member commonly operates as receiver and as sender for multicast based group communication. In addition, real-time communication such as voice or video over IP places severe temporal requirement on mobility protocols: Seamless handover scenarios need to limit disruptions or delay to less than 100 ms. Jitter disturbances are not to exceed 50 ms. Note that 100 ms is about the duration of a spoken syllable in real-time audio.
While multicast routing itself has been proposed to support mobility in the Internet (Helmy, 2000), consensus on an efficient, robust and widely deployable scheme of multicast for mobile hosts is still lacking (Schmidt \& W{\"a}hlisch, 2005a). In this review we will summarize the state of the art in current work on multicast to Mobile IPv6 networks. The principle conceptual problems are discussed and analyzed. Propositions for improvement and possible directions to further proceed towards a mobile multicast are presented.",

  abstract = "Voice and video conferencing have well established as regular communication services within the wired Internet. Facing the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and mobile communication, they are on the spot to be launched within a wireless Internet infrastructure. Following an 802.11, 802.16 or 3G standard, wireless networks provide enough bandwidth to support data intensive communication services such as videoconferencing. The vision of nomadic users at roaming devices performing synchronous communication, such as voice or videoconferencing over IP (VoIP/VCoIP), is around, but raises new challenges for the Internet infrastructure.
In conferencing scenarios addressability raises the first major issues. To globally call a device, a routable IP address must be in use. On a large scale such address space is only provided by IPv6. To identify a communication partner's current device, a supplementary global user locating scheme is needed. In wireless infrastructures, where users share limited bandwidth from a restricted frequency space, multicasting is needed to enable group conferencing compliant to transmission resources and without placing the burden of dedicated group-server infrastructure.
At the same time, synchronous real-time applications s. a. VoIP and VCoIP place new demands on the quality of IP mobility services: Packet loss, delay and delay variation (jitter) in a constant bit rate scenario need careful simultaneous control. A spoken syllable is about the payload of 100 ms continuous voice traffic. Each individual occurrence of packet loss above 1 \%, latencies over 100 ms or jitter exceeding 50 ms will clearly alienate or even distract the user. Audio and visual streams in video conferencing additionally require tight synchronization. Inter-stream latencies should remain below 30 ms for audio arriving ahead, 40 ms for audio being behind. While uni-directional distribution may compensate quality deficits by buffers, available techniques of hiding packet loss at the cost of delay and jitter or vice versa are of limited use in conferencing. Their requirements impose strong challenges on a mobile Internet scenario. Challenges are even tightened by multicast-based group communication, since in conferencing scenarios each member commonly operates as receiver and as sender. Real-time requirements consequently are a major driving force for the development of a seamless mobile Internet layer.
In concordance with communication capabilities video coding techniques have evolved, as well. The latest standard for video coding H.264/AVC (ITU H.264, 2005), although designed as a generic standard, is predestined for applications like mobile video communications (Stockhammer, Hannuksela \& Wiegand, 2003). Besides enhanced compression efficiency it delivers also network friendly video representation for interactive (video telephony) and non-interactive applications (broadcast, streaming, storage, and video on demand). H.264/AVC provides gains in compression efficiency of up to 50\% over a wide range of bit rates and video resolutions compared to previous standards. While H.264/AVC decoding software has been successfully deployed on handhelds, high computational complexity still prevents pure software encoders in current mobile systems. There are however also fast hardware implementations available (see a list in Wikipedia, H.264, 2006). Next generation codecs like Scalable Video Coding (SVC) are already in a design state (Reichel, Schwarz, \& Wien, 2005, Schwarz et.al., 2004). The main new feature, scalability, addresses schemes for delivery of video to diverse clients over heterogeneous networks, particularly in scenarios where the downstream conditions are not known in advance. The basic idea is that one encoded stream can serve networks with varying bandwidths or clients with different display resolutions or systems with different storage resources, which is an obvious advantage in heterogeneous networks prevalent in mobile applications.",

In this paper, we make several contributions towards a generic peer-to-peer (P2P) videoconferencing solution that extends into the mobile realm. We describe the essential building blocks for conference management and media distribution that are necessary for a distributed conferencing approach. Establishing a distributed SIP conference focus, participants share the conference according to their individually given capabilities and resources in terms of bandwidth and processing power rather than in a centralized and fixed way. Overall concepts and SIP-primitives for such an autonomous organization are presented.

Source Specific Multicast (SSM) facilitates transparent inter-domain routing and is expected to globally disseminate to many users and services. However, mobility support for Source Specific Multicast is still known to be a major open problem.
In this paper, we propose the Enhanced Tree Morphing (ETM) protocol for extending SSM  routing to mobile multicast sources. The scheme  dynamically adapts SSM forwarding states to sender mobility, and  transforms  (morphs) source specific distribution trees into new, optimal trees rooted at a relocated source. ETM is  simple, robust and secure, while it admits superior performance in packet forwarding at a low signaling overhead. Extensive evaluations based on a full protocol implementation, and simulations based on real-world topology data are performed, granting full insight into the properties of packet loss and delay stretch, protocol convergence times and router state evolution during single and rapidly repeated handovers. In a constant bit rate scenario, an ETM  source handover typically leads to a slightly increasing delay of the first data packet, only. When operating on realistic network topologies, the protocol uniformly converges within less than 50 ms, thereby sustaining robustness under rapid source movement at all speeds common to our mobile world.  Further optimizations are identified for FMIPv6 and for multihomed nodes.",

At second, a solution to the mobile source authentication problem is presented that complies to IPv6 mobility signaling standards. Using an autonomously verifiable one-way authentication based on cryptographically generated addresses, a common design is derived to jointly comply with the mobile any source and source specific multicast protocols that are currently proposed.

  abstract = "The Internet topology has evolved over the past decades in an evolutionary process and continues to grow. Recently, it has attracted much attention from the networking and physics communities, as it forms a unique operational instance of a planetary-scale network environment. Several measurement projects observing the Internet have been undertaken over the past years, out of which Skitter, its successor Archipelago (Ark) and Dimes have established as continuous recordings of the vivid process of network formation.

In this paper we compare Internet measurement data obtained from Skitter, Ark and Dimes by analyzing the Internet node degree distributions and correlations at IP node and router level. This comparative analysis was enabled by a data conversion and processing tool-chain implemented as an extension to the BRITE topology generator which we introduce, as well. Our results show significant differences in higher nodal degrees. Correlation analysis indicates that DIMES scans discover Internet links to a fairly uniform degree, while parts remain invisible within Skitter and Ark data. Mid-range, oscillating spatial autocorrelations  are discovered as a signature of memory effects in Internet topology.

Further on we analyze implications of the Internet structure as attained in both, its core and edge vicinities.  Mobile multicast routing performance is quantized by the number of states minimally required for servicing listener or sender mobility. Results show a surprisingly low mobility overhead as compared to general multicast forwarding state management. As continuous mobility handovers necessarily occur between access routers located in geographic vicinity, we finally investigate the hypothesis that geographically adjacent edge networks attain a reduced network distances as compared to arbitrary Internet nodes. The evaluation of edge distance distributions in different regions for IP ranges, clustered according to their geographic location, reveals a stable correlation of geographic and network proximity at Internet edges.",

Stimulated by the need of applications alternative multicast mechanisms have been developed. P2P technologies have enabled group distribution on the application or service middleware layer. A significantly simplified routing approach gave rise to the lean, source-specific multicast in IP. Henceforth the debate developed about which approach proves suitable for providing the superior capabilities towards a scalable, efficient and deployable group communication service.

This paper discusses problems, requirements and current trends for deploying group communication in real-world scenarios from an integrated perspective. We introduce Hybrid Shared Tree, a new architecture and routing approach to combine network- and subnetwork-layer multicast services in end-system domains with transparent, structured overlays on the inter-domain level. This hybrid solution is highly scalable and robust and offers provider-oriented features to stimulate deployment.

Mobile information technologies today are pervasive and prevalent across most generations and countries and augur well for knowledge reception and learning processes within everydays life. In ubiquitously advising  life long learning opportunities the paradigm of mobile users questions our common approaches of implementing teaching and learning: Mobile use patterns are short and fast, they frequently interrupt established contexts while nomadic users commonly are on edge with multiple activities taking place in parallel. Handheld devices in addition admit specific, non standard designs and are considered personal companions.

In this paper we present an approach to dynamic, ``on demand'' production of content, which is personalised and specifically adapted to dedicated mobile devices. Starting from IEEE LOM eLearning Objects, i.e., small standardised self consistent knowledge entities, we process formats, appearance and contextual structures to transform re-usable content objects into the desired targed context. Beside Web data for mobile browsers we will detail out an example of feeding the specific iPod potentials, i.e., its navigation, and a handheld Sony gaming station.

All implementations are based on the educational content management system hylOs, which we will briefly introduce. Enabled through an advanced authoring toolset, hylOs allows to define contextual hyperlink overlays, as well as instructional overlays of a given eLearning object mesh. Based on a powerful Ontological Evaluation Layer, additional meaningful overlay relations between knowledge objects are derived autonomously within hylOs.

At second we  introduce a straightforward extension to multicast routing for transforming (morphing) source specific delivery trees into optimal trees rooted at a relocated source. All packet forwarding is done free of tunneling. Multicast service disruption and signaling overhead for the  algorithms remain close to minimal.
Further on we evaluate the proposed scheme using both, analytical estimates and stochastic simulations based on a variety of real-world Internet topology data. Detailed comparisons are drawn to  bi-directional tunneling,  as well as to proposals on concurrent distribution trees.",

  abstract = "Over the last few years, networking technologies and distributed information systems have moved up the OSI layer and are established well within application-centric middleware. Most recently, content overlay networks have matured, incorporating the semantics of data files into their self-organisational structure with the aim of optimising data-centric distributed indexing and retrieval. In educational content management, simple file distribution is considered insufficient. Instead, IEEE LOM standardised eLearning objects have been well established as the basic building blocks for educational online content. They are nicely suited for self-explorative learning approaches within adaptive hypermedia applications. Even though eLearning objects typically reside within content repositories, they may propagate metadata relations beyond repository limits. Given the explicit meaning of these interobject references, a semantic net of content strings can be knotted, overlaying the repository infrastructure.
In this present paper, we briefly introduce our educational content management system hylOs. Enabled through an advanced authoring toolset, hylOs allows the definition of instructional overlays of a given eLearning object mesh. Based on a newly introduced Ontological Evaluation Layer, additional meaningful overlay relations between knowledge objects are shown to derive autonomously. A technology framework to extend the resulting semantic nets beyond repository limits is also presented. The Hypermedia Learning Objects System (hylOs) is built upon the more general Media Information Repository (MIR) and the MIR adaptive context linking environment (MIRaCLE): its linking extension. MIR is an open system supporting the standard XML, CORBA and JNDI. hylOs benefits from manageable information structures, sophisticated access logic and high-level authoring tools like the eLO editor responsible for the semi-manual creation of meta data and WYSIWYG like XML content editing, allowing for rapid distributed content development.",

Mobile IPv6 handover performance is strongly topology dependent and results in inferior service quality in wide area scenarios. To approach seamless mobility in IPv6 networks predictive, reactive and proxy schemes have been proposed for improvement. In this article we analyse and compare handover performance and frequencies for the corresponding protocols, as they are an immediate measure on service quality. Using analytical methods as well as stochastic simulations, we calculate the performance decreases originating from different handover schemes, the expected number of handovers as functions of mobility and proxy ratios, as well as the mean correctness of predictions. In detail we treat the more delicate case of these rates in mobile multicast communication.
 It is obtained that performance benefits, expected from simple analysis of predictive schemes, do not hold in practice. Reactive and predictive handovers rather admit comparable performance. Hierarchical proxy environments  -- foremost in regions of high mobility -- can significantly reduce the processing of inter--network changes. Reliability of handover predictions is found on average at about 50 \%.",

Rapidly emerging multimedia group applications such as IPTV, MMORPGs and video conferencing increase the demand for mobile group communication, but a standard design of mobile multicast is still awaited. The traditional Internet approach of Any Source Multicast (ASM) routing remains hesitant to spread beyond walled gardens, while the simpler and more selective Source Specific Multicast (SSM) is expected to globally disseminate to many users and services. However, mobility support for Source Specific Multicast is still known to be a major open problem. In this paper we introduce the Enhanced Tree Morphing (ETM), an optimized multicast routing protocol for transforming (morphing) source specific distribution trees into optimal trees rooted at a relocated source. Following up on previous results for the initial Tree Morphing, we present enhancements that lead to a simpler protocol with significantly optimized performance values in both, forwarding performance and protocol robustness.

Recently, it has attracted much attention from the networking and physics communities, as it forms a unique operational instance of a planetary-scale network environment. Several measurement projects observing the Internet have been undertaken over the past years, out of which Skitter and Dimes have established as continuous recordings of the vivid process of network formation.

In this paper we compare Internet measurement data obtained from Skitter and Dimes by analyzing the Internet evolution, its degree distributions and correlations at IP node level. This comparative analysis was enabled by a data conversion and processing tool-chain implemented as an extension to the BRITE topology generator which we introduce, as well. Our results show significant differences in higher nodal degrees. Correlation analysis indicates that DIMES scans discover Internet links to a fairly uniform degree, while parts remain invisible within Skitter data. Mid-range, oscillating autocorrelations  are discovered as a signature of memory effects in Internet topology. Further on we analyze implications of the Internet structure as attained in both, its core and edge vicinities, for mobility management and mobile multicast routing performance.",

Corresponding works for developing efficient mobile multicast management are emergent. Both problems simultaneously expose routing complexity between subsequent points of attachment as a characteristic parameter for handover performance in access networks.

As continuous mobility handovers necessarily occur between access routers located in geographic vicinity, this paper investigates on the hypothesis that geographically adjacent edge networks attain a reduced network distances as compared to arbitrary Internet nodes.
We therefore evaluate and analyze edge distance distributions in various regions for clustered IP ranges on their geographic location such as a city. We use traceroute to collect packet forwarding path and round-trip-time of each intermediate node to scan-wise derive an upper bound of the node distances.  Results of different scanning origins are compared to obtain the best estimation of network distance of each pair. Our results are compared with corresponding analysis of CAIDA Skitter data, overall leading to fairly stable, reproducible edge distance distributions. As a first conclusion on expected impact on handover performance measures, our results indicate a general optimum for handover anticipation time in 802.11 networks of 25 ms.",

  an approach to dynamic, 'on demand' production of content, which is
  personalized and specifically adapted to dedicated mobile devices.
  Starting from IEEE LOM eLearning Objects, i.e., small standardized self

  contextual structures to transform re-usable content objects into the
  desired target context. Beside Web data for mobile browsers we will
  detail out an example of feeding the specific iPod potentials, i.e., its

  allows defining contextual hyperlink overlays, as well as instructional
  overlays of a given eLearning object mesh. Based on a powerful

  layer multicast solutions. Problems arising from mobile group
  communication in general, in the case of multicast listener mobility and
  for mobile Any Source Multicast as well as Source Specific Multicast
  senders are documented subsequently.  General aspects of multicast
  distribution trees are derived. The principal approaches to multicast
  mobility are introduced along with sample solutions as presented to the
  IETF. Special focus is dedicated on Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
  senders. We propose extensions to multicast routing for transforming
  (morphing) previous delivery trees into optimal trees rooted at a
  relocated source. This extension scheme only requires basic signaling
  mechanisms, explicit joins and prunes, which are present in current
  multicast routing protocols such as PIM-SM. First evaluations grounded on
  real-world Internet topologies indicate network performance superior to
  traditional distribution schemes. An evaluation of future trends
  finalizes this paper.",

  abstract = "Mobility support in IPv6 networks recently has been released
  as an RFC, promising to continuously operate devices seamlessly roaming
  between IP networks. Associated with the paradigm of ubiquitous computing
  and communication, network technology is on the spot to deliver voice and
  videoconferencing as a standard internet solution. However, current
  roaming procedures are too slow to remain seamless for real-time
  applications, thus stimulating major discussions on improvements to meet
  real-time communication requirements. Multicast mobility still waits for
  a convincing design.  The scope of this paper is twofold. At first we
  review common Internet mobility approaches. Concentrating the focus on
  real-time mobility we analysize the temporal behaviour of MIPv6 and
  re-examine the key technologies for optimisation. The second part of this
  paper is dedicated to mobility support for group conferencing. We
  introduce current approaches for seamless multicast extensions to Mobile
  IPv6. Key issues of multicast mobility are discussed. Both, analytically
  and by simulations comparisons are drawn between handover performance
  characteristics, with special focus on the M-HMIPv6 approach.",

However, SSM  is designed for \'a priori known and  changeless addresses of multicast sources and thus withstands any easy extension to mobility. Up until now only few approaches arose from the Internet research community, leaving SSM source mobility as a major open problem.
This paper introduces a straightforward extension to multicast routing for transforming (morphing) source specific delivery trees into optimal trees rooted at a relocated source. All packet forwarding is done free of tunneling. Multicast service disruption and signaling overhead for the  algorithms remain close to minimal.
Furtheron we evaluate the proposed scheme using both, analytical estimates and stochastic simulations based on a variety of real-world Internet topology data. Detailed comparisons are drawn to  bi-directional tunneling,  as well as to proposals on concurrent distribution trees.",

  abstract = "Over the last years IEEE LOM eLearning Objects have been well established as the basic building blocks for educational online content. Equipped with an expressive set of metadata and structured by a variety of named relations, they are nicely suited for self-explorative learning approaches within adaptive hypermedia applications. The authoring of such 'Knowledge Nuggets', though, not only requires content editing, but the provision of meta descriptors and numerous interrelations. Facing the latter in the context of large repositories, where a new object may attain relations to any previously filed entity, clearly demonstrates the effort to be requested from an author.

In the present paper we update the status of our educational content management system hylOs. We introduce instructional design concepts and tools, as well as a content acquisition and analysis toolset, targeting at the semi-automated generation of eLearning Objects. Starting from classroom recordings or offline content production, automated keyword extraction and classification is applied to the raw learning object.

In the second part of this paper we redefine and sharpen the semantic of LOM relations, thereby extending its set by entities missing from the educational perspective. We construct an ontology and inference rules for these inter--object relations.
Based on this newly introduced Ontological Evaluation Layer and the automated classifications, appropriate relations between learning objects are autonomously derived.

These solutions have been implemented in the Hypermedia Learning Objects System (hylOs), our prototype of an eLearning content management system. hylOs is built upon the more general Media Information Repository (MIR) and the MIR adaptive context linking environment (MIRaCLE), its linking extension. MIR is an open system supporting the standard XML, CORBA and JNDI. hylOs benefits from manageable information structures, sophisticated access logic and high-level authoring tools like the eLO editor responsible for the semi-manual creation of meta data and WYSIWYG like content editing, allowing for rapid distributed content development.",

  abstract = "Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors, and
   technical implementations at different protocol layers.  Multicast
   data distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowest
   available layer, but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicast
   technologies throughout the Internet requires an adaptive service
   binding at runtime.  Today, it is difficult to write an application
   that runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the most
   efficient multicast service available in the network.  Facing
   robustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to using a
   stable, upper layer protocol controlled by the application itself.
   This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for
   transparent communication in underlay and overlay, and grants access
   to the different multicast flavors.  It proposes an abstract naming
   by multicast URIs and discusses mapping mechanisms between different
   namespaces and distribution technologies.  Additionally, it describes
   the application of this API for building gateways that interconnect
   current multicast domains throughout the Internet.",

The recent deployment of smart grids promises to bring numerous advantages
 in terms of energy consumption reduction in both homes and businesses. A
 more transparent and instantaneous measurement of electricity consumption
 through smart meters utilization leads to an enhancement in the ability of
 monitoring, controlling and predicting energy usage. Nevertheless, it also
 has associated drawbacks related to the privacy of customers, since such
 management might reveal their personal habits, which electrical appliances
 they are using at each moment, whether they are at home or not, etc. In this
 work, we present a privacy-enhanced architecture for smart metering aimed at
 tackling this threat by means of encrypting individual measurements while
 allowing the electricity supplier to access the aggregation of the
 corresponding decrypted values.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and analysis of DNS over CoAP (DoC), a new proposal for secure and privacy-friendly name resolution of constrained IoT devices. We implement different design choices of DoC in RIOT, an open-source operating system for the IoT, evaluate performance measures in a testbed, compare with DNS over UDP and DNS over DTLS, and validate our protocol design based on empirical DNS IoT data. Our findings indicate that plain DoC is on par with common DNS solutions for the constrained IoT but significantly outperforms when additional, CoAP standard features are used such as block-wise transfer or caching. With OSCORE for end-to-end security, we can save more than 10 kBytes of code memory compared to DTLS while enabling group communication without compromising the trust chain when using intermediate proxies or caches. We also discuss a scheme for very restricted links that compresses redundant or excessive information by up to 70\%.},
