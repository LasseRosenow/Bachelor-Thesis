	abstract = {Wireless last mile technology is becoming a challenging competitor to conventional wired last mile access systems like DSL and cable modems or even fiber-optic cables. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has developed a standard for fixed broadband wireless access systems namely IEEE 802.16. Its OFDM mode targets frequency bands below 11GHz.
This paper gives an overview of the OFDM-based transmission mode of the IEEE 802.16 standard. The medium access control (MAC) and the physical layer are described in detail. Especially the MAC frame structure is elaborated. An analytical performance evaluation of an example scenario is performed which results in overall system performance measures. Especially the interaction of fragmentation and padding of OFDM symbols and its effect on the system capacity is evaluated. Furthermore, different MAC layer configurations with different levels of robustness are analyzed. Optional features to resist challenging channel conditions are outlined. Their trade off, i.e., a reduced MAC layer capacity is pointed out. It is shown that the system can be optimized while maintaining the necessary robustness against environmental challenges. A prototypical IEEE 802.16 protocol stack including a sophisticated channel model has been implemented. By means of this stochastic event-driven computer simulator, downlink and uplink delay as well as throughput evaluation is performed. Thus, performance results based on meaningful MAC configuration examples are provided. Simulative and analytical results are compared.},

@article{lz-cfs-76,
    abstract = {A new approach to the problem of evaluating the complexity ("randomness") of finite sequences is presented. The proposed complexity measure is related to the number of steps in a self-delimiting production process by which a given sequence is presumed to be generated. It is further related to the number of distinct substrings and the rate of their occurrence along the sequence. The derived properties of the proposed measure are discussed and motivated in conjunction with other well-established complexity criteria.},
